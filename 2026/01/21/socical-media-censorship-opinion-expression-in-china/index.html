It received one of the highest marks in that class. It was the very last academic essay I wrote (and still proud of). It was written for my last English as Second Language (ESL) course when I was an undergraduate student at University of Wisconsin Madison. It is a long article, and the article itself is not free from grammatical mistakes, you have been warned.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been 12 years, censorship still exists in China and the situation has gotten worse everywhere else around the world. I think it is important for me to leave this article here to remind myself I have done some research on this topic before, and it should not be forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>FOR ANY READER FROM CHINA, PLEASE DO NOT SPREAD THIS ARTICLE IN CHINA, THIS IS FOR YOUR SAFETY</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Internet is an important tool in modern society, people use it every day to interact with each other. Censorship, as exists in other kind of medium, exist within the internet. As the internet grows and evolves over time, the internet censorship also evolves. Bambauer (2012) believed that during the early stage of censorship, which he referred to as Censorship v1.0, censorship on the internet is impossible. When the censorship was applied for the first time, which he referred to as Censorship v2.0, only a few countries applied this technology, and the content that were filtered were usually politically related. When more and more countries created their own censorship system and started to censor the internet, internet censorship evolves to become Censorship v3.0. At this stage, countries censored information regardless of their political system. The purpose is usually described as protecting citizens (p. 3). For western countries, information censored are usually related to child pornography, hate speech, and material that may violate copyright (Bambauer, 2012, p. 3). The internet censorship system in China, however, is described as something in stage 2. Bambauer (2012, p. 3) pointed out that that censorships are acceptable if citizens in these countries are notified. However, the situation is not the same in China. As one of the largest countries in the world, China has created the most sophisticated censorship system in the world. This system targets mainly at social media platforms.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>Despite the fact that Facebook and Twitter are two of the most popular social networking sites in the world, only a small amount of people in China are able to access them. Yet, people in China are active on the Chinese alternative of these social networking sites. Based on the report by Synthsio (2013), Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform created by Sina company in 2009, has gained 209 million users by the end of 2012.  Qzone, which is a social media platform created by Tencent company, has gained 600 million active users (p. 8). The amount of users on both platforms are large enough to demonstrate that Chinese people are quite active on the internet. It may even create a false sense that people in China are able to express their ideas freely or discuss current affairs on these social media platforms. However, a close analysis on a recent event and how government acted during the event reveals that even though people are able to discuss more about public events in recent years, the censorship on social media still exists. Through quick deletion of posts related to unwanted information on domestic social media platforms and blocking foreign social media sites, Chinese government is able to control the social media and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>As alternatives to Twitter and Facebook, Weibo and Qzone provide people with an important way to express their opinions on current events. On July 23rd 2011, two high speed train crashed into each other near the city of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. According to CNN (Jiang, 2011), at least 38 people were killed including two Americans. Despite the fact that journalists from around the country tried their best to arrive at Wenzhou as soon as possible, CNN emphasized that major news media in China did not report about this news the next day. On the contrary, Weibo, as a social media platform, was where people got first-hand information about this event. In fact, the first report and SOS post sent by passengers on the train was just 13 minutes after the crash happed (Wu, 2012, p. 7). Wu (2012) pointed out that the official rescue of the survivors was concluded by the Ministry of Railways 7 hours after the train crash. Yet, a 2-year-old survivor was found and saved by the SWAT team 21 hours after this serious disaster (p. 2). Though this lucky girl survived the accident, she was heavily injured and lost both of her parents, she was blessed by netizens around the country, hoping that she could get well soon. Meanwhile, doubts were arose about whether the Ministry of Railway had put enough effort on rescuing. The ministry, however, gave the worst answer they can give.</p>
<p>CNN reported that when being asked about why the ministry stopped rescue work while there were  people still alive, the spokesperson from the Ministry of the Railways said that they had put enough effort in rescue and regarded the survival of the little girl as &quot;a miracle&quot; (Jiang, 2011). This, as Wu (2012) commented, trigged large amount of criticism directed toward the Ministry as well as the Chinese government on Weibo (p. 2). By analyzing 330 posts from eight users who started to use &quot;Wenzhou High Speed Train&quot; as part of their account name on Sina Weibo during the event, Wu identified that 38% of the posts were related to criticism of the Railway Ministry (p. 13). Needless to say, due to the lack of efforts made by the Railway Ministry as well as the distrust of the state controlled media, Weibo had become a place for Chinese netizens to express their opinion toward the collision disaster. However, several days after the event, the intervention made by the government caused significant change to what people can express on Weibo.</p>
<p>The Weibo, as a representation of the social networking sites in China, provided netizens with a space to express their opinions during the Wenzhou high speed train collision. Unfortunately, the censorship system was also triggered as the Weibo posts related to criticism of the government increased. Chinese Digital Times, which is supported by School of Information at UC-Berkley, regards itself as an independent media that report China without being censored. They reported that the censorship was applied by the Chinese government two days after the disaster. It is reported that the Central Propaganda Department urge Chinese media not to report any news related to the crash on their front page and that all posts on social media that are related to the event ought to be deleted immediately (&quot;Directives from the Ministry of Truth,&quot; 2011). Although it is hard to verify whether the department had released this kind of command, findings based on the data provided by Wu accidentally endorsed that the command might be true. It can be noticed from the graph given by Wu (2012, p. 8) that the amount of Weibo tweets posted by the eight users that he tracked reduced significantly from above 100 posts per day to under 20 posts per day during a specific period in between July.23rd to July.30th. For the 8 users that Wu tracked, this amount of posts on the event during that time were truly abnormal. The deletion practice might be a reasonable explanation for this sharp decrease. If this assumption is true, then the fast speed in deleting posts may also imply that the censorship system in China does its job quite efficiently.</p>
<p>A group of researchers focused on 3,567 users who talked about sensitive political topics on Weibo regularly made the same conclusion. They attested that 30% of the deletion occurred in less than 30 minutes after the content was posted, and only 10% of the posts were deleted after 24 hours (Zhu, Phipps, Pridgen, Crandall, &amp; Wallach, 2013, p. 12). Though Zhu et al. made their conclusions based on a small sample group relative to the large amount of users who use Weibo, it can be assumed that with more users, the amount of posts that need to be deleted will only increase and thus requires more effort. For other social media platforms in China, including forum posts and blog posts, researchers have reached the same conclusion as Zhu et.al. By analyzing 11,382,221 posts King et al.(2014) concluded that the majority of posts related to the topics that they tracked were censored within one day after posting (p. 330). To reach the goal of making deletions of Weibo as well as other social media platforms effectively, it is necessary for the government to implement the correct method.</p>
<p>The method used by Chinese government is complicated and due to the fact that the censorship in China is not transparent, a lot of assumptions have been made on the methods used for censorship. Most studies have highlighted the use of keyword filtering.  It is believed that this method stops people from posting content that contain specific keywords (King, Pan, &amp; Roberts, 2013, p. 328).  To use this method, censors can either prevent users from posting the content that includes the keyword or delete the content with the keywords after they are posted. However, as it is impossible for people to actually access the list of blocked keywords, lots of researchers have attempted to make assumptions on the blocked lists of keywords. King et .al. (2014) referred the technology of censoring prior to posting as &quot;automated review&quot; and by creating and running their own forum in China, these researchers got an idea of how &quot;automated review&quot; worked.  They pointed out that when the posts submitted by user match specific keywords, it will not be posted immediately but will be held for administrators to review.  By reverse engineering, they found out that most of the keywords were usually suggesting collective action or opinions on the government. However, they also mentioned that websites in China including BBS and those which allow people to make follow up comments did not rely heavily on this automated technology as every posts or comments were still read in order to keep accuracy of the censorship  (p. 20). Zhu et al. (2013) described a similar finding while analyzing Sina Weibo. They wrote that while trying to post a string containing the word &quot;政法委书记&quot; (Secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee), their posts were immediately rejected with a warning saying that they had violated certain Weibo regulations (this is probably because this secretary was under investigation for corruption at that time and people were not allowed to discuss that publicly). When they tried to submit another post containing the phrase &quot;Falun&quot; (representing a banned religious in China), the post was not posted immediately but submitted for review and appeared 5 hours later (p. 6). The consistent finding from King et al. and Zhu et al. indicated that automated censorship technology are largely used by Chinese social media sites.</p>
<p>However, it is believed that this technology is not good enough to ensure that &quot;unwanted&quot; information are censored. This is mainly because of the characteristic of the Chinese language. Over time, Chinese netizens have developed the method of substituting words that may potentially be censored with other words with irrelevant meaning but sound or look alike (King et al., 2013, p. 328). Example for this include 目田 (meaning eye field) represented the blocked word 自由 (which means freedom)  (King et al., 2013, p. 328). 自由 and 目田 looked very much alike, but the latter one is meaningless. Another choice of netizens is to use words that sound the same to replace the sensitive keywords. 毒豺 (which means poisonous dhole if translated directly) is used to represent the blocked word独裁 (which means dictatorship), these two words sounds similar but the first one has no meaning to censors. There are many more examples of the same kind of words that were created by netizens to avoid censorship. It is believed that when using these replacement characters, the automated censorship will not be able to identify them as keywords and netizens can bypass the censorship easily. This reveals that the automatic keyword censorship is not reliable and to become more accurate in filtering information, websites have to put a moderate amount of effort on censorship after the information is posted.</p>
<p>King et al. and other researchers find that for information that is already posted, manual intervention by censors has to be done. King et al. (2013) explained how manual censorship worked in forums and other blogging websites, this excluded the Weibo created by Sina. They found that for manual censorship, the method of substitution would no longer be effective. They noticed that to achieve the goal of manual censorship, government and websites have to form consensus on what to censor and ask thousands of individuals to do the censorship work within 24 hours (p. 330). This implied that the manual censorship requires a lot of individuals in order to do their job quickly which means these people have to be professional in identifying and censoring &quot;unwanted&quot; information. CNN reporters estimated that the number of people that Chinese government employed to do manual censorship was around 2 million in 2013, which is more than people served in the army (Hunt &amp; Xu, 2013, p. 1). This number might be large, but as the number of netizens online is even larger, the actual number of censors might be much larger than this rough estimate. Other researchers gave assumptions about the kind of posts that are most likely to be deleted. According to the research conducted by Bamman et al., posts with certain set of words are most likely to be deleted. They argue that these posts  not only include commonly known terms that are sensitive due to politics but also include those that had become sensitive because of current events (Bamman, O&#39;Connor, &amp; Smith, 2012, p. 15).  Obviously, the censorship implemented by the government had negative influence on what people can express on social media platforms inside China. However, for popular social networking websites that are not in China, a different method is used to achieve the same goal.</p>
<p>Though effort put on the censorship of domestic social media platforms is impressive, it is impossible for the Chinese government to control social networking sites that were not created by Chinese company, they chose to block these websites completely. When foreigners come to China for the first time, they might be surprised when trying to access Facebook or Twitter as the only thing they are able to get is an error screen rather than the normal websites no matter how many times they try. China, as described in Facebook&#39;s IPO filing, is one of the four countries (China, Iran, North Korea, and Syria) that completely or partially block access to Facebook (Constine, 2012, p.3). Other websites that are blocked include Twitter, YouTube and Google plus which are all popular social networking sites around the world. In an effort to block these websites, a certain technology have to be implemented to the whole internet in China.</p>
<p>The Great Firewall of China is the main effort made by Chinese government to block access to these websites. Fang Binxing, who is the former president of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, is commonly regarded as the founder of the Great Firewall of China. It is believed that Fang&#39;s effort in building the Great Firewall started in 1999, and over the years the censorship system has evolved (Anonymous, 2013). According to the Economists(2013) that in early years, the Great Firewall only take into account websites that had strong relevance to sensitive political topics in China. However, in recent years, the Great Fire wall is becoming smarter. When user tried to access Facebook and Twitter, they will be taken to an error page. It is also believed that when users searched for certain words on Google, their access to the search engine will blocked for 90 seconds though the user still have access to other websites (p. 2).  Facebook and Google and not the only websites that are affected by the Great Firewall. In an early study conducted by Zittrain and Edelman (2003, p. 71), they found that 18,931 websites were inaccessible from within China. This indicated that if the assumption raised by the anonymous writer about the evolvement about Great Firewall is true, the blocked websites will greatly increase. To correctly block the large number of websites, it is important for the Great Firewall to use a correct methodology.</p>
<p>It is commonly believed that the Great Firewall was implemented at a national level, and lots of methods were used in order to achieve the goal of blocking. Wright (2014, p. 121) highlighted the use of DNS poisoning method used by the Great Firewall. DNS, which is short for Domain Name Server, is what provides the computers with the correct IP address of the websites that users want to visit so that they are directed correctly. The DNS poisoning method that Wright referred to will provide users with the wrong address for the websites they want to visit and they will then be directed to an error page or even a fake website. According to Wright (2014), the DNS poisoning method varies by provinces in China and the type of error given by DNS server in different province is quite different (p. 122). This indicated even though the Great Firewall and censorship policy are enforced at a national level, the specific implementation of this policy varies.</p>
<p>Another finding indicated that &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; are used when certain key words is found while inspecting the TCP packets (Clayton, Murdoch, &amp; Watson, 2006, p. 1). TCP packets are known as the information that are transmitted between users and websites, when the &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; were sent, users are not likely to receive the real information they requested from the server. Clayton et al. (2006) noticed that even when the &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; were sent, the correct packets were still transmitted. Their experiment also showed by ignoring the &quot;wrong packets&quot; sent intentionally by the Great Firewall, they were still able to access the blocked websites (p. 15).  Even though this sounds complicated, it is actually easy to bypass the Great Firewall in practice.</p>
<p>While Twitter is blocked in China, some report showed that China has 35million of active users on Twitter as of the second quarter of 2012. This number was estimated after seven surveys during 2009 with a total sample of 8000 people conducted by GlobalWebIndex Market Company(Ong, 2012). This number is most likely to be untrue as many Chinese people do not even have an idea of what Twitter is. However, a later study might provide a better idea for this number. By carefully examining the language of the tweet as well as the time zone which the user belongs to, the number of Chinese users on Twitter is estimated to be 8,000 (Millward, 2013, p. 2). Though 8,000 is pretty small when compare to the number of people who use Sina Weibo, it clearly shows that people in China have method to bypass the intervention of the Great Firewall. Bamman et al. (2012) made a comparison between posts that were posted in Chinese on Weibo and Twitter. They revealed that users were able to talk about politics more freely on Twitter.  He demonstrated in a graph that posts containing three highly political related names are significantly more on Twitter than on Weibo (p.8). Thus, it can be inferred that the block of Twitter and many other social networking sites that are not based in China are more likely due to political reasons.</p>
<p>Some people may argue that Chinese people do not actually care about whether the internet is censored. Jenkins cited Yang and argue that most of the people in China firmly believed that the government is correct on internet censorship. They believed that the internet censorship in China is just a &quot;moral measurement&quot; made by the Chinese government to enforce its role as an internet regulator (Yang, 2013, p. 3). In my opinion, it is also believed that due to the spread of rumors on Weibo and other unhealthy information on the internet, keeping the censorship is necessary for the government to maintain a stable society. However, it is worth noting that this &quot;moral measurement&quot; implemented by the Chinese government may also trigger outrage among certain group of people in China. GitHub, a popular community for software developers around the world to learn and communicate with each other, was blocked by the Great Firewall in early 2013. This made the software developers in China angry as they believe blocking such website is unreasonable and it will be difficult for them to access good resources that may help their development if the website is blocked (Ivan Zhai, 2013). This indicated that there are people who care about the censorship and the censorship were not solely for moral purposes. In the long term, the extensive censorship will make it difficult for people to share and retrieve information on foreign websites and hurt the researches in China.</p>
<p>In conclusion, though censorship exists in China, people have gained some opportunities to express their opinions thanks to the raise of Weibo and other social media platforms. As maintaining the censorship will be beneficial to the government to keep the status quo, internal censorship will exists in the coming future for most websites based in China. The external blockage of some of the social networking sites that were not created in China will also continue to limit how people can get information through internet. In the future, the game between censorship and Chinese netizens will not end. But as the technology advances, the censorship will better. With advanced censorship, it is likely that more people will try to find why they were blocked and more and more people will be able to bypass the Great Firewall eventually.</p>
