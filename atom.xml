      <![CDATA[<div class="note primary"><h4 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h4><p>This article was originally written and submitted for grading on April 27th 2014. It received one of the highest marks in that class. It was the very last academic essay I wrote (and still proud of). It was written for my last English as Second Language (ESL) course when I was an undergraduate student at University of Wisconsin Madison. It is a long article, and the article itself is not free from grammatical mistakes, you have been warned.</p><p>It&#39;s been 12 years, censorship still exists in China and the situation has gotten worse everywhere else around the world. I think it is important for me to leave this article here to remind myself I have done some research on this topic before, and it should not be forgotten.</p><p><strong>FOR ANY READER FROM CHINA, PLEASE DO NOT SPREAD THIS ARTICLE IN CHINA, THIS IS FOR YOUR SAFETY</strong></p></div><p>Internet is an important tool in modern society, people use it every day to interact with each other. Censorship, as exists in other kind of medium, exist within the internet. As the internet grows and evolves over time, the internet censorship also evolves. Bambauer (2012) believed that during the early stage of censorship, which he referred to as Censorship v1.0, censorship on the internet is impossible. When the censorship was applied for the first time, which he referred to as Censorship v2.0, only a few countries applied this technology, and the content that were filtered were usually politically related. When more and more countries created their own censorship system and started to censor the internet, internet censorship evolves to become Censorship v3.0. At this stage, countries censored information regardless of their political system. The purpose is usually described as protecting citizens (p. 3). For western countries, information censored are usually related to child pornography, hate speech, and material that may violate copyright (Bambauer, 2012, p. 3). The internet censorship system in China, however, is described as something in stage 2. Bambauer (2012, p. 3) pointed out that that censorships are acceptable if citizens in these countries are notified. However, the situation is not the same in China. As one of the largest countries in the world, China has created the most sophisticated censorship system in the world. This system targets mainly at social media platforms.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Despite the fact that Facebook and Twitter are two of the most popular social networking sites in the world, only a small amount of people in China are able to access them. Yet, people in China are active on the Chinese alternative of these social networking sites. Based on the report by Synthsio (2013), Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform created by Sina company in 2009, has gained 209 million users by the end of 2012.  Qzone, which is a social media platform created by Tencent company, has gained 600 million active users (p. 8). The amount of users on both platforms are large enough to demonstrate that Chinese people are quite active on the internet. It may even create a false sense that people in China are able to express their ideas freely or discuss current affairs on these social media platforms. However, a close analysis on a recent event and how government acted during the event reveals that even though people are able to discuss more about public events in recent years, the censorship on social media still exists. Through quick deletion of posts related to unwanted information on domestic social media platforms and blocking foreign social media sites, Chinese government is able to control the social media and maintain the status quo.</p><p>As alternatives to Twitter and Facebook, Weibo and Qzone provide people with an important way to express their opinions on current events. On July 23rd 2011, two high speed train crashed into each other near the city of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province. According to CNN (Jiang, 2011), at least 38 people were killed including two Americans. Despite the fact that journalists from around the country tried their best to arrive at Wenzhou as soon as possible, CNN emphasized that major news media in China did not report about this news the next day. On the contrary, Weibo, as a social media platform, was where people got first-hand information about this event. In fact, the first report and SOS post sent by passengers on the train was just 13 minutes after the crash happed (Wu, 2012, p. 7). Wu (2012) pointed out that the official rescue of the survivors was concluded by the Ministry of Railways 7 hours after the train crash. Yet, a 2-year-old survivor was found and saved by the SWAT team 21 hours after this serious disaster (p. 2). Though this lucky girl survived the accident, she was heavily injured and lost both of her parents, she was blessed by netizens around the country, hoping that she could get well soon. Meanwhile, doubts were arose about whether the Ministry of Railway had put enough effort on rescuing. The ministry, however, gave the worst answer they can give.</p><p>CNN reported that when being asked about why the ministry stopped rescue work while there were  people still alive, the spokesperson from the Ministry of the Railways said that they had put enough effort in rescue and regarded the survival of the little girl as &quot;a miracle&quot; (Jiang, 2011). This, as Wu (2012) commented, trigged large amount of criticism directed toward the Ministry as well as the Chinese government on Weibo (p. 2). By analyzing 330 posts from eight users who started to use &quot;Wenzhou High Speed Train&quot; as part of their account name on Sina Weibo during the event, Wu identified that 38% of the posts were related to criticism of the Railway Ministry (p. 13). Needless to say, due to the lack of efforts made by the Railway Ministry as well as the distrust of the state controlled media, Weibo had become a place for Chinese netizens to express their opinion toward the collision disaster. However, several days after the event, the intervention made by the government caused significant change to what people can express on Weibo.</p><p>The Weibo, as a representation of the social networking sites in China, provided netizens with a space to express their opinions during the Wenzhou high speed train collision. Unfortunately, the censorship system was also triggered as the Weibo posts related to criticism of the government increased. Chinese Digital Times, which is supported by School of Information at UC-Berkley, regards itself as an independent media that report China without being censored. They reported that the censorship was applied by the Chinese government two days after the disaster. It is reported that the Central Propaganda Department urge Chinese media not to report any news related to the crash on their front page and that all posts on social media that are related to the event ought to be deleted immediately (&quot;Directives from the Ministry of Truth,&quot; 2011). Although it is hard to verify whether the department had released this kind of command, findings based on the data provided by Wu accidentally endorsed that the command might be true. It can be noticed from the graph given by Wu (2012, p. 8) that the amount of Weibo tweets posted by the eight users that he tracked reduced significantly from above 100 posts per day to under 20 posts per day during a specific period in between July.23rd to July.30th. For the 8 users that Wu tracked, this amount of posts on the event during that time were truly abnormal. The deletion practice might be a reasonable explanation for this sharp decrease. If this assumption is true, then the fast speed in deleting posts may also imply that the censorship system in China does its job quite efficiently.</p><p>A group of researchers focused on 3,567 users who talked about sensitive political topics on Weibo regularly made the same conclusion. They attested that 30% of the deletion occurred in less than 30 minutes after the content was posted, and only 10% of the posts were deleted after 24 hours (Zhu, Phipps, Pridgen, Crandall, &amp; Wallach, 2013, p. 12). Though Zhu et al. made their conclusions based on a small sample group relative to the large amount of users who use Weibo, it can be assumed that with more users, the amount of posts that need to be deleted will only increase and thus requires more effort. For other social media platforms in China, including forum posts and blog posts, researchers have reached the same conclusion as Zhu et.al. By analyzing 11,382,221 posts King et al.(2014) concluded that the majority of posts related to the topics that they tracked were censored within one day after posting (p. 330). To reach the goal of making deletions of Weibo as well as other social media platforms effectively, it is necessary for the government to implement the correct method.</p><p>The method used by Chinese government is complicated and due to the fact that the censorship in China is not transparent, a lot of assumptions have been made on the methods used for censorship. Most studies have highlighted the use of keyword filtering.  It is believed that this method stops people from posting content that contain specific keywords (King, Pan, &amp; Roberts, 2013, p. 328).  To use this method, censors can either prevent users from posting the content that includes the keyword or delete the content with the keywords after they are posted. However, as it is impossible for people to actually access the list of blocked keywords, lots of researchers have attempted to make assumptions on the blocked lists of keywords. King et .al. (2014) referred the technology of censoring prior to posting as &quot;automated review&quot; and by creating and running their own forum in China, these researchers got an idea of how &quot;automated review&quot; worked.  They pointed out that when the posts submitted by user match specific keywords, it will not be posted immediately but will be held for administrators to review.  By reverse engineering, they found out that most of the keywords were usually suggesting collective action or opinions on the government. However, they also mentioned that websites in China including BBS and those which allow people to make follow up comments did not rely heavily on this automated technology as every posts or comments were still read in order to keep accuracy of the censorship  (p. 20). Zhu et al. (2013) described a similar finding while analyzing Sina Weibo. They wrote that while trying to post a string containing the word &quot;政法委书记&quot; (Secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee), their posts were immediately rejected with a warning saying that they had violated certain Weibo regulations (this is probably because this secretary was under investigation for corruption at that time and people were not allowed to discuss that publicly). When they tried to submit another post containing the phrase &quot;Falun&quot; (representing a banned religious in China), the post was not posted immediately but submitted for review and appeared 5 hours later (p. 6). The consistent finding from King et al. and Zhu et al. indicated that automated censorship technology are largely used by Chinese social media sites.</p><p>However, it is believed that this technology is not good enough to ensure that &quot;unwanted&quot; information are censored. This is mainly because of the characteristic of the Chinese language. Over time, Chinese netizens have developed the method of substituting words that may potentially be censored with other words with irrelevant meaning but sound or look alike (King et al., 2013, p. 328). Example for this include 目田 (meaning eye field) represented the blocked word 自由 (which means freedom)  (King et al., 2013, p. 328). 自由 and 目田 looked very much alike, but the latter one is meaningless. Another choice of netizens is to use words that sound the same to replace the sensitive keywords. 毒豺 (which means poisonous dhole if translated directly) is used to represent the blocked word独裁 (which means dictatorship), these two words sounds similar but the first one has no meaning to censors. There are many more examples of the same kind of words that were created by netizens to avoid censorship. It is believed that when using these replacement characters, the automated censorship will not be able to identify them as keywords and netizens can bypass the censorship easily. This reveals that the automatic keyword censorship is not reliable and to become more accurate in filtering information, websites have to put a moderate amount of effort on censorship after the information is posted.</p><p>King et al. and other researchers find that for information that is already posted, manual intervention by censors has to be done. King et al. (2013) explained how manual censorship worked in forums and other blogging websites, this excluded the Weibo created by Sina. They found that for manual censorship, the method of substitution would no longer be effective. They noticed that to achieve the goal of manual censorship, government and websites have to form consensus on what to censor and ask thousands of individuals to do the censorship work within 24 hours (p. 330). This implied that the manual censorship requires a lot of individuals in order to do their job quickly which means these people have to be professional in identifying and censoring &quot;unwanted&quot; information. CNN reporters estimated that the number of people that Chinese government employed to do manual censorship was around 2 million in 2013, which is more than people served in the army (Hunt &amp; Xu, 2013, p. 1). This number might be large, but as the number of netizens online is even larger, the actual number of censors might be much larger than this rough estimate. Other researchers gave assumptions about the kind of posts that are most likely to be deleted. According to the research conducted by Bamman et al., posts with certain set of words are most likely to be deleted. They argue that these posts  not only include commonly known terms that are sensitive due to politics but also include those that had become sensitive because of current events (Bamman, O&#39;Connor, &amp; Smith, 2012, p. 15).  Obviously, the censorship implemented by the government had negative influence on what people can express on social media platforms inside China. However, for popular social networking websites that are not in China, a different method is used to achieve the same goal.</p><p>Though effort put on the censorship of domestic social media platforms is impressive, it is impossible for the Chinese government to control social networking sites that were not created by Chinese company, they chose to block these websites completely. When foreigners come to China for the first time, they might be surprised when trying to access Facebook or Twitter as the only thing they are able to get is an error screen rather than the normal websites no matter how many times they try. China, as described in Facebook&#39;s IPO filing, is one of the four countries (China, Iran, North Korea, and Syria) that completely or partially block access to Facebook (Constine, 2012, p.3). Other websites that are blocked include Twitter, YouTube and Google plus which are all popular social networking sites around the world. In an effort to block these websites, a certain technology have to be implemented to the whole internet in China.</p><p>The Great Firewall of China is the main effort made by Chinese government to block access to these websites. Fang Binxing, who is the former president of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, is commonly regarded as the founder of the Great Firewall of China. It is believed that Fang&#39;s effort in building the Great Firewall started in 1999, and over the years the censorship system has evolved (Anonymous, 2013). According to the Economists(2013) that in early years, the Great Firewall only take into account websites that had strong relevance to sensitive political topics in China. However, in recent years, the Great Fire wall is becoming smarter. When user tried to access Facebook and Twitter, they will be taken to an error page. It is also believed that when users searched for certain words on Google, their access to the search engine will blocked for 90 seconds though the user still have access to other websites (p. 2).  Facebook and Google and not the only websites that are affected by the Great Firewall. In an early study conducted by Zittrain and Edelman (2003, p. 71), they found that 18,931 websites were inaccessible from within China. This indicated that if the assumption raised by the anonymous writer about the evolvement about Great Firewall is true, the blocked websites will greatly increase. To correctly block the large number of websites, it is important for the Great Firewall to use a correct methodology.</p><p>It is commonly believed that the Great Firewall was implemented at a national level, and lots of methods were used in order to achieve the goal of blocking. Wright (2014, p. 121) highlighted the use of DNS poisoning method used by the Great Firewall. DNS, which is short for Domain Name Server, is what provides the computers with the correct IP address of the websites that users want to visit so that they are directed correctly. The DNS poisoning method that Wright referred to will provide users with the wrong address for the websites they want to visit and they will then be directed to an error page or even a fake website. According to Wright (2014), the DNS poisoning method varies by provinces in China and the type of error given by DNS server in different province is quite different (p. 122). This indicated even though the Great Firewall and censorship policy are enforced at a national level, the specific implementation of this policy varies.</p><p>Another finding indicated that &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; are used when certain key words is found while inspecting the TCP packets (Clayton, Murdoch, &amp; Watson, 2006, p. 1). TCP packets are known as the information that are transmitted between users and websites, when the &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; were sent, users are not likely to receive the real information they requested from the server. Clayton et al. (2006) noticed that even when the &quot;TCP reset packets&quot; were sent, the correct packets were still transmitted. Their experiment also showed by ignoring the &quot;wrong packets&quot; sent intentionally by the Great Firewall, they were still able to access the blocked websites (p. 15).  Even though this sounds complicated, it is actually easy to bypass the Great Firewall in practice.</p><p>While Twitter is blocked in China, some report showed that China has 35million of active users on Twitter as of the second quarter of 2012. This number was estimated after seven surveys during 2009 with a total sample of 8000 people conducted by GlobalWebIndex Market Company(Ong, 2012). This number is most likely to be untrue as many Chinese people do not even have an idea of what Twitter is. However, a later study might provide a better idea for this number. By carefully examining the language of the tweet as well as the time zone which the user belongs to, the number of Chinese users on Twitter is estimated to be 8,000 (Millward, 2013, p. 2). Though 8,000 is pretty small when compare to the number of people who use Sina Weibo, it clearly shows that people in China have method to bypass the intervention of the Great Firewall. Bamman et al. (2012) made a comparison between posts that were posted in Chinese on Weibo and Twitter. They revealed that users were able to talk about politics more freely on Twitter.  He demonstrated in a graph that posts containing three highly political related names are significantly more on Twitter than on Weibo (p.8). Thus, it can be inferred that the block of Twitter and many other social networking sites that are not based in China are more likely due to political reasons.</p><p>Some people may argue that Chinese people do not actually care about whether the internet is censored. Jenkins cited Yang and argue that most of the people in China firmly believed that the government is correct on internet censorship. They believed that the internet censorship in China is just a &quot;moral measurement&quot; made by the Chinese government to enforce its role as an internet regulator (Yang, 2013, p. 3). In my opinion, it is also believed that due to the spread of rumors on Weibo and other unhealthy information on the internet, keeping the censorship is necessary for the government to maintain a stable society. However, it is worth noting that this &quot;moral measurement&quot; implemented by the Chinese government may also trigger outrage among certain group of people in China. GitHub, a popular community for software developers around the world to learn and communicate with each other, was blocked by the Great Firewall in early 2013. This made the software developers in China angry as they believe blocking such website is unreasonable and it will be difficult for them to access good resources that may help their development if the website is blocked (Ivan Zhai, 2013). This indicated that there are people who care about the censorship and the censorship were not solely for moral purposes. In the long term, the extensive censorship will make it difficult for people to share and retrieve information on foreign websites and hurt the researches in China.</p><p>In conclusion, though censorship exists in China, people have gained some opportunities to express their opinions thanks to the raise of Weibo and other social media platforms. As maintaining the censorship will be beneficial to the government to keep the status quo, internal censorship will exists in the coming future for most websites based in China. The external blockage of some of the social networking sites that were not created in China will also continue to limit how people can get information through internet. In the future, the game between censorship and Chinese netizens will not end. But as the technology advances, the censorship will better. With advanced censorship, it is likely that more people will try to find why they were blocked and more and more people will be able to bypass the Great Firewall eventually.</p><h3 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h3><p>Anonymous.

      <![CDATA[<div class="note primary"><h4 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h4><p>This article was originally written and submitted for grading on April 27th 2014. It received one of the highest marks in that class. It was the very last academic essay I wrote (and still proud of). It was written for my last English as Second Language (ESL) course when I was an undergraduate student at University of Wisconsin Madison. It is a long article, and the article itself is not free from grammatical mistakes, you have been warned.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been 12 years, censorship still exists in China and the situation has gotten worse everywhere else around the world. I think it is important for me to leave this article here to remind myself I have done some research on this topic before, and it should not be forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>FOR ANY READER FROM CHINA, PLEASE DO NOT SPREAD THIS ARTICLE IN CHINA, THIS IS FOR YOUR SAFETY</strong></p>

<p>Internet is an important tool in modern society, people use it every day to interact with each other. Censorship, as exists in other kind of medium, exist within the internet. As the internet grows and evolves over time, the internet censorship also evolves. Bambauer (2012) believed that during the early stage of censorship, which he referred to as Censorship v1.0, censorship on the internet is impossible. When the censorship was applied for the first time, which he referred to as Censorship v2.0, only a few countries applied this technology, and the content that were filtered were usually politically related. When more and more countries created their own censorship system and started to censor the internet, internet censorship evolves to become Censorship v3.0. At this stage, countries censored information regardless of their political system. The purpose is usually described as protecting citizens (p. 3). For western countries, information censored are usually related to child pornography, hate speech, and material that may violate copyright (Bambauer, 2012, p. 3). The internet censorship system in China, however, is described as something in stage 2. Bambauer (2012, p. 3) pointed out that that censorships are acceptable if citizens in these countries are notified. However, the situation is not the same in China. As one of the largest countries in the world, China has created the most sophisticated censorship system in the world. This system targets mainly at social media platforms.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I finished working on a project that deals with mTLS in Java, more specifically, it was to setup mTLS to connect to a message queue. After quite a lot of effort, I finally got everything working correctly. Hopefully this article can be helpful to readers seeking help on this topic.</p><h2 id="TLS"><a href="#TLS" class="headerlink" title="TLS"></a>TLS</h2><p>To understand what mTLS or mutual TLS is, we first need to understand what TLS is. TLS stands for Transport Layer Security, it is the defector protocol to provide communications security over the network.</p><p>The best place to understand this is through the TLS standards document. According to the TLS 1.3 standards document or rfc8446<sup><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXRhdHJhY2tlci5pZXRmLm9yZy9kb2MvaHRtbC9yZmM4NDQ2">1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></sup>:</p><span id="more"></span><blockquote><p>[...]<br>TLS allows client&#x2F;server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.<br>[...]<br>The primary purpose of TLS protocol is to provide a secure channel between two communicating peers.</p></blockquote><p>To conform to the TLS protocol, this specific secure channel should provide authentication, confidentiality and integrity. For the server side of this secure channel, authentication is mandatory; while for client side, authentication is optional. Data sent through the channel after establishment is only visible to the endpoints, and the data can not be modified by attackers without detection.</p><p>The TLS protocol consists of two main components: the handshake protocol and the record protocol. The RFC document described the handshake protocol in detail:</p><blockquote><p>[...]<br>The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters of a connection.<br>[...]<br>The TLS handshake is an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol which is intended to provide both one-way authenticated (server-only) and mutually authenticated (client and server) functionality.</p></blockquote><p>The handshake process can be divided into three phases: Key Exchange, Server Parameters and Authentication. The process starts with a <code>ClientHello</code> message described below.</p><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">uint16 ProtocolVersion;</span><br><span class="line">opaque Random[<span class="number">32</span>];</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">uint8 CipherSuite[<span class="number">2</span>];    <span class="comment">/* Cryptographic suite selector */</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    ProtocolVersion legacy_version = <span class="number">0x0303</span>;    <span class="comment">/* TLS v1.2 */</span></span><br><span class="line">    Random random;</span><br><span class="line">    opaque legacy_session_id&lt;<span class="number">0.</span><span class="number">.32</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">    CipherSuite cipher_suites&lt;<span class="number">2.</span><span class="number">.2</span>^<span class="number">16</span><span class="number">-2</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">    opaque legacy_compression_methods&lt;<span class="number">1.</span><span class="number">.2</span>^<span class="number">8</span><span class="number">-1</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">    Extension extensions&lt;<span class="number">8.</span><span class="number">.2</span>^<span class="number">16</span><span class="number">-1</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125; ClientHello;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The server will respond to this message with a <code>ServerHello</code> message, if it is able to negotiate:</p><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    ProtocolVersion legacy_version = <span class="number">0x0303</span>;    <span class="comment">/* TLS v1.2 */</span></span><br><span class="line">    Random random;</span><br><span class="line">    opaque legacy_session_id_echo&lt;<span class="number">0.</span><span class="number">.32</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">    CipherSuite cipher_suite;</span><br><span class="line">    uint8 legacy_compression_method = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    Extension extensions&lt;<span class="number">6.</span><span class="number">.2</span>^<span class="number">16</span><span class="number">-1</span>&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125; ServerHello;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This completes the Key Exchange phase of the handshake. Immediately following the <code>ServerHello</code> message, the server will send the <code>EncryptedExtensions</code>, and optionally <code>CertificateRequest</code> if the server requires client-based authentication.</p><p>That is the end of the server parameters phase and the start of authentication phase.</p><p>The start of the authentication phase will be a <code>Certificate</code> message from the server, and the client will also send a <code>Certificate</code> message if it has received a <code>CertificateRequest</code> message previously. Most notably, the <code>Certificate</code> presented by both the server and the client must be of <code>X509</code> type. And the RFC specifically mentioned scenarios where a <code>bad_certificate</code> alert will be sent:</p><blockquote><p> Any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using an MD5 hash MUST abort the handshake with a &quot;bad_certificate&quot; alert. SHA-1 is deprecated, and it is RECOMMENDED that any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using a SHA-1 hash abort the handshake with a &quot;bad_certificate&quot; alert.  For clarity, this means that endpoints can accept these algorithms for certificates that are self-signed or are trust anchors.</p></blockquote><p>The <code>CertificateVerifiy</code> message follows the <code>Certificate</code> message, and is used to provide explicit proof that an endpoint possesses the private key corresponding to its certificate. This is achieved by providing a signature signed using the private key and the other party verify the signature using the public key.</p><p>In typical HTTPS (or HTTP over TLS) communication, the HTTP client would also act as TLS client, the client can only initiate HTTP request once the TLS handshake has been completed <sup><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXRhdHJhY2tlci5pZXRmLm9yZy9kb2MvaHRtbC9yZmMyODE4">2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></sup>. However, in mutual TLS setting, as mentioned above, the client will need to provide certificate to authenticate itself as well.</p><h2 id="Java-keystore-and-keytool"><a href="#Java-keystore-and-keytool" class="headerlink" title="Java keystore and keytool"></a>Java keystore and <code>keytool</code></h2><p>For developers who have used Java before, keystore shouldn&#39;t be an unfamiliar concept. It is used to store keys and certificates. A keystore can have two distinct kind of entries: key entry and Trusted certificate entries.</p><p>A key entry can contain a private key, an X.509 certificate (can be v1, v2, or v3) containing the public key that matches this entry&#39;s private key. Optionally, one or more CA certificates that belong to the preceding certificate&#39;s trust chain<sup><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnJlZGhhdC5jb20vZW4vZG9jdW1lbnRhdGlvbi9yZWRfaGF0X2FtcS82LjMvaHRtbC9zZWN1cml0eV9ndWlkZS9zc2wtamF2YWtleXN0b3Jlcw==">3<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></sup>.</p><p>Note that a private key entry can have its own password, this can cause issue if that password is different from the one for keyStorePassword. It&#39;s better to always set them to the same or just remove the password from the privateKey before adding it to the keystore.</p><p><code>keytool</code> is bundled with JDK and can be use to create a new keystore or manipulate an existing keystore.

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently I got myself a Rock 4 C+ single board computer. This is a SBC that was released in 2022, so it is a bit old. From the spec, this thing looks quite promising. It has a Rockchip RK3399T SoC that uses Arm® big.LITTLE™ technology (Dual Cortex®-A72 frequency 1.5GHz and a Quad Cortex-A53 frequency 1.0GHz). And dual channel 4GB 64bit LPDDR4 memory and dual micro-HDMI output. At 47 NZD (exclude shipping cost), it&#39;s definitely a bargain (the Raspberry Pi 3b+ cost more than that, and it only got <strong>1GB</strong> RAM)</p><p>In this article, we will go through the process of installing ArchLinux on this Rock 4C+ single board computer.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="Initial-Investigation"><a href="#Initial-Investigation" class="headerlink" title="Initial Investigation"></a>Initial Investigation</h3><p>Let&#39;s start by exploring around and finding the existing resources first.</p><p>The first choice in this case would be to look at the officially supported distro from the vendor. It turned out the vendor provided several distros to choose from<span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93aWtpLnJhZHhhLmNvbS9Sb2NrNC9kb3dubG9hZHM=">^1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. However, they are not up-to-date -- most of them were last updated in 2023.</p><p>The next place to look at would be the wiki, specifically the archlinux arm wiki. It turned out, there is no official wiki for this model. The closest article is for Rock64, which is a completely different model <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9hcmNobGludXhhcm0ub3JnL3BsYXRmb3Jtcy9hcm12OC9yb2NrY2hpcC9yb2NrNjQ=">^2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p><h3 id="Initial-Installation"><a href="#Initial-Installation" class="headerlink" title="Initial Installation"></a>Initial Installation</h3><p>Install the ArchLinux is not as difficult as one might think. We can selectively followed the Rock64 Wiki article and loaded Linux onto a brand new 64G MicroSD card. Once we finished the installation, we can follow steps <a href="/2023/10/08/arch-linux-on-rpi3">here</a> and chroot into the installation and installed some of the packages that&#39;s necessary (e.g. sudo, wget).</p><p>We are one step closer to be able to boot the system, however, we are missing an important part -- the bootloader.</p><h3 id="Compile-and-flash-the-bootloader"><a href="#Compile-and-flash-the-bootloader" class="headerlink" title="Compile and flash the bootloader"></a>Compile and flash the bootloader</h3><p>The bootloader for this specific board is not readily available, so we only two choices:</p><ul><li>Extract the bootloader for this board from the readily available distro vendor provided.</li><li>Compile the mainline bootloader on my own and install it.</li></ul><p>We are going to choose the later one for the sake of this article.

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently I got myself a Rock 4 C+ single board computer. This is a SBC that was released in 2022, so it is a bit old. From the spec, this thing looks quite promising. It has a Rockchip RK3399T SoC that uses Arm® big.LITTLE™ technology (Dual Cortex®-A72 frequency 1.5GHz and a Quad Cortex-A53 frequency 1.0GHz). And dual channel 4GB 64bit LPDDR4 memory and dual micro-HDMI output. At 47 NZD (exclude shipping cost), it&#39;s definitely a bargain (the Raspberry Pi 3b+ cost more than that, and it only got <strong>1GB</strong> RAM)</p>
<p>In this article, we will go through the process of installing ArchLinux on this Rock 4C+ single board computer.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I found myself needing to run virtual machines quite often, however, with two different types of VMs managed by different hypervisors on my machine, I find it quite inefficient to click through multiple hoops in GUI just to launch a single VM. Therefore, decided to spend time to find ways to improve this workflow.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="The-start-Controlling-hypervisors-from-CLI-and-alias"><a href="#The-start-Controlling-hypervisors-from-CLI-and-alias" class="headerlink" title="The start: Controlling hypervisors from CLI and alias"></a>The start: Controlling hypervisors from CLI and alias</h3><p>As I mentioned previously, I ran two different types of Hypervisors on my machine:</p><ul><li>VirtualBox (For Windows guests)</li><li>QEMU (For Linux guests)<br>Let&#39;s dive into how to control the hypervisors from CLI</li></ul><h4 id="VirtualBox"><a href="#VirtualBox" class="headerlink" title="VirtualBox"></a>VirtualBox</h4><p>In the past, I have attempted to start VirtualBox automatically on Windows host and <a href="/2021/07/10/Advanced-VirtualBox-Auto-start-virtualbox-on-Windows">wrote about it</a>, this mostly involved running a batch script that can control the VirtualBox from the command line.</p><p>Quite conveniently, on Linux, we can use almost the same exact command to control things, so</p><ul><li>To list all the available guests: <code>vboxmanage list --sorted vms</code></li><li>To start a guest, we can use: <code>vboxmanage startvm NAME_OF_GUEST</code></li><li>To power off a guest, we can use <code>vboxmanage controlvm NAME_OF_GUEST poweroff</code></li></ul><h4 id="QEMU"><a href="#QEMU" class="headerlink" title="QEMU"></a>QEMU</h4><p>To control guests managed by KVM, we will need to use <code>virsh</code>. <code>Virsh</code> is part of the <code>libvirt</code> project, which aims to provide a toolkit to manage virtualisation platforms <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlidmlydC5vcmcvaW5kZXguaHRtbA==">^1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. We can use the following commands to find and manage KVM guests:</p><ul><li>To list all the available guests, we can use: <code>virsh --connect=qemu:///system list --all</code></li><li>To start a given guest, we can use: <code>virsh --connect=qemu:///system start NAME_OF_GUEST</code></li><li>To power off a given guest, we can use: <code>virsh --connect=qemu:///system shutdown NAME_OF_GUEST</code></li></ul><p>You may wonder why we need <code>--connect=qemu:///system</code> part in the <code>virsh</code> command above. This is because normally, we would need to run <code>virsh</code> as root (so with <code>sudo</code>). However, if you are a member of the <code>libvirt</code> group, you can use the <code>--connect=qemu:///system</code>. This make things a bit more convenient, especially when we need to use the command in a script.</p><h4 id="Using-alias"><a href="#Using-alias" class="headerlink" title="Using alias"></a>Using alias</h4><p>It&#39;s not difficult to realize, we can greatly simplify our workflow to start a VM if we add them as alias in our bash or zsh config file. For example:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">alias</span> start-dev=<span class="string">&quot;virsh --connect=qemu:///system start dev&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">alias</span> start-server=<span class="string">&quot;vboxmanage startvm server&quot;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We will be able to avoid typing the command each time with this, however, it is not a sustainable solution as we could have more than 5 guests on the host, and remembering those aliases will quickly become a burden.</p><h3 id="Experimentation-Launching-from-Polybar-and-Rofi"><a href="#Experimentation-Launching-from-Polybar-and-Rofi" class="headerlink" title="Experimentation: Launching from Polybar and Rofi"></a>Experimentation: Launching from Polybar and Rofi</h3><p>The next attempt I made was using Polybar and Rofi. In my <a href="/2022/09/17/linux-user-notes-2">previous article</a> on opening Zoom with a single click, I explored the possibility of combining Polybar and rofi by adding a new custom script launcher in Polybar. We can use a similar solution here.</p><p>Let&#39;s create the following script for VirtualBox first:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><figcaption><span>.config&#x2F;rofi&#x2F;virtualbox&#x2F;launcher.sh</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">vboxmanage startvm $(vboxmanage list --sorted vms | rofi -dmenu -p <span class="string">&#x27;Select vm to launch&#x27;</span> | awk -F <span class="string">&#x27; &#x27;</span> <span class="string">&#x27;&#123;print $NF&#125;&#x27;</span> )</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The <code>awk</code> command is used to sanitize the output of the command and leave only VM name, other part of the command is straightforward, so I wouldn&#39;t get into details on this.</p><p>A similar one can be created for <code>virsh</code>. I used the following for the script:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Retrieve all the running guest</span></span><br><span class="line">ACTIVE_MACHINES=<span class="string">&quot;<span class="subst">$(virsh --connect=qemu:///system list --state-running --name)</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Retrieve all the stopped guest</span></span><br><span class="line">NON_ACTIVE_MACHINES=<span class="string">&quot;<span class="subst">$(virsh --connect=qemu:///system list --state-shutoff --name)</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Retrieve all guests</span></span><br><span class="line">ALL_MACHINES=<span class="string">&quot;<span class="subst">$(virsh --connect qemu:///system list --all|sed &#x27;/^[[:space:]]*$/d&#x27;)</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Get the selected VM</span></span><br><span class="line">selected=<span class="string">&quot;<span class="subst">$(echo <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$ALL_MACHINES</span>&quot;</span>\|</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="subst"><span class="string">        sed 1,2d \|</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="subst"><span class="string">        rofi -dmenu -p &#x27;Available VMs:&#x27; \|</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="subst"><span class="string">        awk -F &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;&#123;print $2&#125;&#x27;)</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ -z <span class="variable">$selected</span> ]]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">exit</span> 0</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Start or shutdown the selected machine based on its state.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ <span class="variable">$NON_ACTIVE_MACHINES</span> = *<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span>&quot;</span>* ]]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  virsh --connect=qemu:///system start <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">  dunstify <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span> is starting&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">elif</span> [[ <span class="variable">$ACTIVE_MACHINES</span> = *<span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span>&quot;</span>* ]]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">  virsh --connect=qemu:///system shutdown <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span>&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">  dunstify <span class="string">&quot;<span class="variable">$selected</span> is shutting down&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This works almost perfectly. However, I still have to move the mouse to click on the icon on the Polybar whenever I want to launch a guest machine. This is still not efficient enough for me.</p><h3 id="Solution-Application-Entry-with-Rofi"><a href="#Solution-Application-Entry-with-Rofi" class="headerlink" title="Solution: Application Entry with Rofi"></a>Solution: Application Entry with Rofi</h3><p>After much searching, I ended up creating an application entry for the launcher. More specifically, here&#39;s the steps I took:</p><ul><li>Create an entry under <code>$HOME/.local/share/applications/vm.desktop</code></li><li>Inside this entry, I put the following content</li></ul><figure class="highlight ini"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="section">[Desktop Entry]</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Categories</span>=System<span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Name</span>=VM Dmenu</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">GenericName</span>=Virtual Machine Manager</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Exec</span>=libvirt_dmenu</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Icon</span>=virt-manager</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Keywords</span>=mvm<span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">Type</span>=Application</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ul><li>Then I copied the script I created for the launcher to <code>$HOME/local/bin</code> and named it <code>libvirt_dmenu</code>, I also made sure <code>$HOME/local/bin</code> is in my <code>$PATH</code></li><li>With this settings, I can open the VM menu by just typing in <code>mvm</code> in the rofi dialogue, this greatly simplify things as I can control the VM directly from the rofi.</li></ul><h3 id="Bonus-Rofi-calculator"><a href="#Bonus-Rofi-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Rofi calculator"></a>Bonus: Rofi calculator</h3><p>After doing this, I realized it&#39;s a good idea to create something similar for the calculator as well. I&#39;m so used to Alfred on MacOS where I can directly calculate in the command palette. I did found something similar for rofi called rofi-calc <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3N2ZW5zdGFyby9yb2ZpLWNhbGM=">^2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.

The challenge specifically mentions using Firefox, so let&#39;s go with that. After launching Firefox, I took my first look at the website. It does seem quite <em>innocent</em>, right?</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-25_22-55.png"></p><p>It&#39;s just a form with some checkboxes—what harm can it do? Let&#39;s try interacting with it by filling out the form and clicking some random checkboxes.</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/Tales_of_the_brave_1.png"></p><p>Then I submitted it:</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-25_22-56.png"></p><p>Hmm, nothing happened—except for this pop-up.</p><h2 id="Digging-into-the-JavaScript"><a href="#Digging-into-the-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Digging into the JavaScript"></a>Digging into the JavaScript</h2><p>You wouldn&#39;t expect to get the flag in a popup for a <em>hard</em> challenge, would you? Let&#39;s inspect the HTML code.</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_10-17.png"></p><p>The webpage loads two JavaScript files: <code>index.js</code> and <code>crypto-js.js</code>. Since <code>crypto-js.js</code> is loaded from Cloudflare, it’s likely a standard library. So let’s focus on <code>index.js</code>.</p><p>This is heavily obfuscated code—no wonder it’s a <em>hard</em> challenge.<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-25_23-08_1.png"><br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_10-52.png"></p><p>Let&#39;s take a deep breath and analyze what it does. The first line defines a variable:</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> _$_9b39;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We don’t need to understand <em>how</em> it&#39;s defined—just its value. Since it&#39;s in the global scope, we can execute <code>window._$_9b39</code> in the console to retrieve it:<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_10-43.png"></p><p>Now that we understand the variable definitions, let&#39;s see how they interact with the eval() function. According to MDN, <code>eval()</code> evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its result.</p><p>The key part of the parameter being evaluated can be rewritten as:</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title class_">CryptoJS</span>[<span class="string">&quot;AES&quot;</span>][<span class="string">&quot;decrypt&quot;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">.<span class="title function_">toString</span>(<span class="title class_">CryptoJS</span>[<span class="string">&quot;enc&quot;</span>][<span class="string">&quot;Utf8&quot;</span>])</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>CryptoJS provides an example of AES decryption:</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Decrypt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> bytes = <span class="title class_">CryptoJS</span>.<span class="property">AES</span>.<span class="title function_">decrypt</span>(ciphertext, <span class="string">&#x27;secret key 123&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> originalText = bytes.<span class="title function_">toString</span>(<span class="title class_">CryptoJS</span>.<span class="property">enc</span>.<span class="property">Utf8</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">log</span>(originalText); <span class="comment">// &#x27;my message&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Setting up a breakpoint at the <code>.toString</code> function in <code>crypto-js.js</code> and stepping through it with a debugger helps us understand its purpose.</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_13-58.png"></p><p>The decrypted result is an unformatted script passed to <code>eval()</code>. We can format it manually or step through the debugger. I chose the latter and formatted the code in the debugger. Here’s the beautified version:<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_14-07.png"></p><h2 id="Cracking-the-Telegram-Bot"><a href="#Cracking-the-Telegram-Bot" class="headerlink" title="Cracking the Telegram Bot"></a>Cracking the Telegram Bot</h2><p>To forward a message to a Telegram chat, we first need a chat ID. But before that, we must identify the bot’s username. Telegram provides an API for retrieving bot info:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">https://api.telegram.org/bot&#123;token&#125;/getMe</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Replacing <code>{token}</code> with our retrieved token reveals the bot’s username:<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/20250326172821.png"><br>Next, we create a chat with the bot and obtain the chat ID using:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">https://api.telegram.org/bot&#123;token&#125;/getUpdates</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/20250326173810.png"><br>Entering the <code>chat.id</code> into the description field sends a message, but I encountered an error in the console initially:</p><figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="punctuation">&#123;</span><span class="attr">&quot;ok&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span><span class="literal"><span class="keyword">false</span></span><span class="punctuation">,</span><span class="attr">&quot;error_code&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span><span class="number">403</span><span class="punctuation">,</span><span class="attr">&quot;description&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span><span class="string">&quot;Forbidden: bot is not a member of the channel chat&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">&#125;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="HTB-Ticket"><a href="#HTB-Ticket" class="headerlink" title="HTB Ticket"></a>HTB Ticket</h3><p>Since this error was on Telegram’s side, I opened a ticket with HTB on Discord.<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_17-46_1.png"><br>HTB quickly resolved the issue, but the bot sent an expired invite link.<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/20250326181115.png"><br>HTB staff confirmed the link <em>should</em> be expired. Looking for alternative clues, I forwarded message IDs from 6 to 12 and got a zip file with a password. Extracting it yielded a Windows binary: <code>Brave.exe</code>.<br><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_18-12.png"></p><h2 id="Tricking-Brave-exe-for-the-Flag"><a href="#Tricking-Brave-exe-for-the-Flag" class="headerlink" title="Tricking Brave.exe for the Flag"></a>Tricking <code>Brave.exe</code> for the Flag</h2><p>Reversing the binary seemed necessary, but I lacked the tools. Fortunately, Carl (Spymky) from my team stepped in. He loaded it in Ghidra but made little progress. Switching to dynamic analysis, he considered online sandboxes like <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9hbnkucnVuLw==">Any.Run<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> and <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9lc2FuZGJveC5jb20v">Joe Sandbox<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> but opted for a local VM with Wireshark.</p><p>Installing the Brave browser and running <code>Brave.exe</code> revealed this:</p><p><img data-src="/2025/03/26/tales-of-the-brave-write-up/2025-03-26_18-52.png"></p><p>The binary accessed <code>zolsc2s65u.htb</code>, a non-public domain.

They are mostly about Kubernetes and Ops side of things, and I found them to be quite interesting and highly recommend watching them if you are interested in the topic or just want to learn something new.</p><h3 id="Embracing-Karpenter-to-scale-optimize-upgrade-Kubernetes"><a href="#Embracing-Karpenter-to-scale-optimize-upgrade-Kubernetes" class="headerlink" title="Embracing Karpenter to scale, optimize &amp; upgrade Kubernetes"></a><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5jY2MuZGUvdi9naGVudDIwMjUtNjE0LWVtYnJhY2luZy1rYXJwZW50ZXItdG8tc2NhbGUtb3B0aW1pemUtdXBncmFkZS1rdWJlcm5ldGVz">Embracing Karpenter to scale, optimize &amp; upgrade Kubernetes<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></h3><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: While I&#39;m still not a big fan of Kubernetes. This video is interesting cause it is about a tool that solves an interesting problem in Kubernetes space: scaling. The author first present some basic definition for Kubernetes and also mentioned the current de-facto solution for scaling in k8s is cluster auto scaler. The issue with cluster auto scaler is that it is not able to scale based on the compute needs (i.e. it is only able to launch a given type of predefined resources), and it is not able to consolidate under utilized resources.<br>He then present a software called <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9rYXJwZW50ZXIuc2gv">Karpenter<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> which looks quite promising -- it can scale different type of instances to handle current resource needs, it can also consolidate pods onto different and underutilized cluster.</p><h3 id="Running-Kubernetes-on-small-scale-lessons-learned-on-operating-small-scale-clusters"><a href="#Running-Kubernetes-on-small-scale-lessons-learned-on-operating-small-scale-clusters" class="headerlink" title="Running Kubernetes on small scale - lessons learned on operating &quot;small scale&quot; clusters"></a><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5jY2MuZGUvdi9naGVudDIwMjUtNjc5LXJ1bm5pbmcta3ViZXJuZXRlcy1vbi1zbWFsbC1zY2FsZS1sZXNzb25zLWxlYXJuZWQtb24tb3BlcmF0aW5nLXNtYWxsLXNjYWxlLWNsdXN0ZXJz">Running Kubernetes on small scale - lessons learned on operating &quot;small scale&quot; clusters<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></h3><p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong>: In this talk, the author shared some of the things he learnt from working with Kubernetes. This also includes some of the best practices I think is very important for developer to learn.

      <![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>In the context of this article, both Android and iOS project means native iOS and Android project, written in Swift or Kotlin. It may work with Flutter or similar technology with some tuning, but the author had no working experience no technology working with those technology at the time of writing.</p></div><p>Quite often in my daily work, I need to run both the iOS simulator and Android emulator at the same time. This would normally mean I would have to have both XCode and Android Studio open and running. Though I&#39;m on a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip, the fact I need to open <strong>two very heavy IDEs</strong> at the same time plus two simulators is something I would rather not do. What&#39;s worse, I need to interact with both IDE to rebuild and redeploy the application to the simulator every time I switch the branch. Eventually, I decided to spend time and investigate how to automate this process.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h3><p>Before we go into the investigation, it is important to define the goal first. The goal here, is <strong>automate the process of building iOS&#x2F;Android app from source using command line and deploy the application to the iOS&#x2F;Android simulator separately</strong>.</p><p>To break it down to smaller steps, the automation we want to create, should</p><ol><li>Detect the project type based on certain criteria;</li><li>Build the project from source;</li><li>Turn on a Simulator&#x2F;Emulator;</li><li>Deploy the project to the running Simulator&#x2F;Emulator;</li><li>Launch the running program;</li></ol><p>This looks like an ambitious project, but it is achievable. However, I have to admit I spent quite a lot of time optimizing and rewriting what I created in order to achieve what I outlined above.</p><h3 id="How"><a href="#How" class="headerlink" title="How?"></a>How?</h3><p>For clarity, in this section, I would go through each of the smaller steps I outlined, and how I achieved them.</p><h4 id="Detect-the-project-type-based-on-certain-criteria"><a href="#Detect-the-project-type-based-on-certain-criteria" class="headerlink" title="Detect the project type based on certain criteria"></a>Detect the project type based on certain criteria</h4><p>Assuming one have no prior knowledge of Android or iOS development, they could still tell the two projects apart easily -- they can simply determine the projects based on files that exists in the project. Here are a few ways I could think about:</p><ul><li>iOS project almost always uses Swift or Objective C, this means, there must be files in the projects that use <code>.swift</code> as extension; Android project almost always uses Kotlin or Java, so <code>.kt</code> or <code>.java</code> would be the file extension to determine the project as Android.</li><li>iOS project usually uses CocoaPod to manage its dependencies -- you would almost always see a Podfile for an iOS project; Android projects would always have some kind of gradle file.</li></ul><p>There are countless other ways, I opt to use gradle file and Podfile to determine the project type.</p><p>So the script would begin with a function to determine the project type, I named this <code>run_mobile_platform</code></p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function"><span class="title">run_mobile_platform</span></span>() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> [ -f <span class="string">&quot;Podfile&quot;</span> ]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;Detected iOS project (Podfile found).&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    build_and_run_ios</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">elif</span> [ -f <span class="string">&quot;build.gradle&quot;</span> ]; <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;Detected Android project (build.gradle found).&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    build_and_run_android</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">else</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">echo</span> <span class="string">&quot;Error: Unable to detect project platform.

We would need to complete <code>build_and_run_ios</code> and <code>build_and_run_android</code>.<br>The first step would be build, this would be assemble the app to binary format from source.</p><div class="tabs" id="build-from-source"><ul class="nav-tabs"><li class="tab active"><a href="#build-from-source-1">Build iOS app from source</a></li><li class="tab"><a href="#build-from-source-2">Build Android app from source</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div class="tab-pane active" id="build-from-source-1"><p>To build iOS source code from command line, you need to use xcodebuild.

<p>Quite often in my daily work, I need to run both the iOS simulator and Android emulator at the same time. This would normally mean I would have to have both XCode and Android Studio open and running. Though I&#39;m on a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip, the fact I need to open <strong>two very heavy IDEs</strong> at the same time plus two simulators is something I would rather not do. What&#39;s worse, I need to interact with both IDE to rebuild and redeploy the application to the simulator every time I switch the branch. Eventually, I decided to spend time and investigate how to automate this process.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve done something with the DNS setup in my local networking. I learnt quite a lot along the way and have decided to write it down for my reference, and for other people who might find this useful.</p><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>I have a quite simple home network setup. My main router is a Linksys WRT1200AC which is running OpenWrt 24.10 branch. I have installed Adblock, Unbound, Stubby, and many other software on this router and even after 10 years, it is still performing well.</p><p>My main homelab server is a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) which I bought recently to replace my Rapsberry Pi 3. As I have mentioned in my previous articles <a href="/2023/07/14/Easy-Self-Hosting-with-Traefik-Proxy">on self hosting</a> and <a href="/2023/12/08/self-hosting-nebula-traefik/">nebula</a>, this Raspberry Pi has been running quite a lot of containers along with the Traefik proxy for quite a while now.</p><h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I often need to setup private domains within my homelab, mainly to experiment with new software. What I want to achieve is within my local LAN network, every device can resolve these private domains and whenever a new private domain is added, it will take effect automatically without my manual intervention.</p><p>For example, in my local network, <code>wallabag.raspberrypi.lan</code> would take me to the wallabag container and <code>static.raspberry.lan</code> would take me to the Nginx container, they are both running on my Raspberry Pi. And <code>lab.raspberrypi.lan</code> would also resolve to the IP of my Raspberry Pi without any intervention.</p><p>The rest of this article will focus on how I achieved the solution that solved both of this problem.</p><span id="more"></span><p>(Note: you might need to flush your DNS cache with <code>sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches</code>)</p><h2 id="Naive-Solution-Modify-hosts-file-on-one-device"><a href="#Naive-Solution-Modify-hosts-file-on-one-device" class="headerlink" title="Naive Solution: Modify hosts file on one device"></a>Naive Solution: Modify hosts file on one device</h2><p>While this may not be what the readers are expecting, it is a solution most people would attempt first. Hosts files are mappings between the host name and IP addresses <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvSG9zdHNfKGZpbGUp">^1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. To access <code>wallabag.raspberrypi.lan</code> from a particular device, you can simply add the domain and IP to the hosts file of that device.</p><p>As an example, on Linux, if you add <code>wallabag.raspberrypi.lan 192.168.1.134</code> to a device&#39;s hosts file (located at <code>/etc/hosts</code>), the domain <code>wallabag.raspberrypi.lan</code> will resolve to <code>192.168.1.134</code> <strong>on this device</strong>.</p><p>Obviously, this is not a great solution -- it doesn&#39;t achieve what I want. You won&#39;t be able to modify the hosts file on your mobile device running iOS or Android easily. And each time you want to experiment with a new domain, you will have to manually add them to your hosts file which will be less than ideal.</p><h2 id="Improved-Solution-Modify-Local-DNS"><a href="#Improved-Solution-Modify-Local-DNS" class="headerlink" title="Improved Solution: Modify Local DNS"></a>Improved Solution: Modify Local DNS</h2><p>This second solution is quite similar to the previous one, but it will work for all the devices in the same network once setup properly.</p><p>The idea for this solution is to modify the local DNS server so it knows how to resolve those private domains.</p><p>For example, if your homelab DNS is using Unbound, you could add the following as part of your Unbound config:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">local-data: &quot;static.raspberrypi.lan. 3600 IN A 192.168.1.134&quot;</span><br><span class="line">local-data: &quot;wallabag.raspberrypi.lan. 3600 IN A 192.168.1.134&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This solution works for every device in the LAN, however, you would still need to keep manually adding all the domains, which is something I would like to avoid.</p><h2 id="Final-solution-Unbound-with-Knot"><a href="#Final-solution-Unbound-with-Knot" class="headerlink" title="Final solution: Unbound with Knot"></a>Final solution: Unbound with Knot</h2><p>This final solution is a bit more complicated, but I think it is worth the time I spent on getting to it.</p><p>Before we get to the details of the solution, we need to understand the concept of DNS zone and authoritative server in DNS. According to Akamai <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWthbWFpLmNvbS9nbG9zc2FyeS93aGF0LWlzLWF1dGhvcml0YXRpdmUtZG5z">^2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>:</p><blockquote><p>Authoritative DNS is the system that keeps official records corresponding to domain names such as IP addresses.</p></blockquote><p>For DNS Zone, Cloudflare had a great explanation <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xvdWRmbGFyZS5jb20vbGVhcm5pbmcvZG5zL2dsb3NzYXJ5L2Rucy16b25lLw==">^3<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>:</p><blockquote><p>A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. A DNS zone is an administrative space which allows for more granular control of DNS components, such as authoritative nameservers.</p></blockquote><p>The authoritative DNS for a DNS zone is also part of its DNS SOA record, so you can find the authoritative DNS server for <code>google.com</code> easily by issuing the following command:</p><figure class="highlight vim"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">dig</span> google.<span class="keyword">com</span>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve done something with the DNS setup in my local networking. I learnt quite a lot along the way and have decided to write it down for my reference, and for other people who might find this useful.</p>
<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>I have a quite simple home network setup. My main router is a Linksys WRT1200AC which is running OpenWrt 24.10 branch. I have installed Adblock, Unbound, Stubby, and many other software on this router and even after 10 years, it is still performing well.</p>
<p>My main homelab server is a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) which I bought recently to replace my Rapsberry Pi 3. As I have mentioned in my previous articles <a href="/2023/07/14/Easy-Self-Hosting-with-Traefik-Proxy">on self hosting</a> and <a href="/2023/12/08/self-hosting-nebula-traefik/">nebula</a>, this Raspberry Pi has been running quite a lot of containers along with the Traefik proxy for quite a while now.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I often need to setup private domains within my homelab, mainly to experiment with new software. What I want to achieve is within my local LAN network, every device can resolve these private domains and whenever a new private domain is added, it will take effect automatically without my manual intervention.</p>
<p>For example, in my local network, <code>wallabag.raspberrypi.lan</code> would take me to the wallabag container and <code>static.raspberry.lan</code> would take me to the Nginx container, they are both running on my Raspberry Pi. And <code>lab.raspberrypi.lan</code> would also resolve to the IP of my Raspberry Pi without any intervention.</p>
<p>The rest of this article will focus on how I achieved the solution that solved both of this problem.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is my first attempt in writing a review for the year. By writing this, I can hopefully provide myself with a clearer picture on what I had learnt in the past year and what I should be prepared for in the coming new year.</p><h3 id="This-blog"><a href="#This-blog" class="headerlink" title="This blog"></a>This blog</h3><p>I haven&#39;t written as many posts as last year, though I still finished six posts in total. These articles are mostly about the issues I or someone within my team solved during our day-to-day work.</p><h3 id="Meet-ups"><a href="#Meet-ups" class="headerlink" title="Meet ups"></a>Meet ups</h3><p>I started to attend meet ups regularly starting July 2024. I found it to be an excellent way to connect with the tech community and learn new stuff. Here are a list of highlights from each of the events I attended and things I learnt from it:</p><ul><li>In July, I attended the GitHub NZ meetup. I learnt about Self-Hosted Action Runners, the speaker mentioned Azure container apps can be used as scalable self-hosted action runners. This is extremely useful for businesses with budget constraint. The talk was recorded and can be found <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2xpZGVvZ2xvcmlhLnRlY2gvZ2l0aHViL3NlbGYtaG9zdGVkLWdpdGh1Yi1ydW5uZXJzLWZvci1mcmVlLw==">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of Azure or anything Microsoft, so when I was at the talk, I immediately thought of doing something similar to thing on GCP with Google App Engine or on AWS using AWS Fargate. To me they are very similar to the Azure Container Apps in that they can scale up and down based on the load.</li><li>In August, I attended an AWS meetup, where the speaker talked about Pulumi and how to use it to reverse engineer an existing infrastructure to Pulumi code. While I&#39;m not really a infrastructure guy, it&#39;s always interesting to learn something new. I do still prefer to use Terraform if I were to start a new project. I&#39;m well aware learning Terraform language is not really as straightforward, it is still the de factor tool&#x2F;language for IaC (infrastructure as code).</li><li>In September, I attended several meet ups. My personal favorite was the Golang meetup. The speakers talked about the newly added Go 1.23 iterators, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3dhaWxzYXBwL3dhaWxz">Wails<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. I haven&#39;t really done any Golang professionally, however, I did several projects using Golang in my spare time, and I&#39;m really amazed by how easy it is to use Go. Regarding the iterators, the speaker had a demo repo <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3kxaGFvL2l0">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. The runner up for my personal favorite was the Java meetup, the speaker talked about the virtual threads in Java and how it differed from other languages. Personally, I haven&#39;t touched Java for a while, and learning about the new Java language feature is always a good thing.</li><li>In October, I also attended several meet ups. I personally really liked the talk given by one of the Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies. The talk focused on the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIuZGV2L2V4cGxvcmUvbGVhcm4tY29yZS13ZWItdml0YWxz">core web vitals<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> and how to optimize them. As a backend dev, it is always good to learn something new about the frontend. The speaker had put the repo <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3RwaXJvcy9nZGctd2VicGVyZg==">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li>In November, I attended the Hack the Box Meetup in Auckland. This is the first ever hack the box event I attended, and I found it really interesting. Hack the Box as a platform is really useful for people to learn about hacking and pen test.</li><li>In December, I attended the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9nZGcuY29tbXVuaXR5LmRldi9ldmVudHMvZGV0YWlscy9nb29nbGUtZ2RnLW5hbm5pbmctcHJlc2VudHMtZ29vZ2xlLWRldmZlc3QtbmFubmluZy0yMDI0Lw==">Devfest in Nanning<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, China. This is the first tech event I attended in China. The topics are mostly about AI. Some interesting talks include using LLM for data analytics, and building Multidimensional Intangible Cultural Heritage Experience Platform with BERT and TensorFlow.</li></ul><p>From next year, I will start to write weekly or monthly recap blog to summarize what I learnt from the each of the meetups or events I attended.</p><h3 id="Tooling-I-Open-Source"><a href="#Tooling-I-Open-Source" class="headerlink" title="Tooling (I  Open Source)"></a>Tooling (I <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Open Source)</h3><p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> I&#39;m not affiliated with any of the projects mentioned here.</p><p>This year marks the marks the third year I worked in the current company. It is also the forth year that I use NeoVim as a development tool. In addition to NeoVim, I found a lot of useful tools this year for my terminal centric workflow. I might write some blog post about them next year, but as a preview, here&#39;s the list of tools I discovered and continued to use in my day-to-day workflow:</p><ul><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9odXJsLmRldi8=">Hurl<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: Hurl is a wrapper around the og curl. It is much much easier to use than curl. For example, you can create a Hurl file (in plain text), and use it as an alternative to curl. You can also use it as a sanity or smoke testing tool. Being plain text means you can commit it a git repository and keep track of things easily.</li><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3NjYWxhci9zY2FsYXI=">Scalar<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: This could be a good open source alternative to Postman.</li><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1JlZG9jbHkvcmVkb2NseS1jbGk=">Redocly<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: Redocly is a open source tool focus around OpenAPI and swagger docs. I had used it in our project at work to combine multiple swagger docs into one big giant combined one.</li><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZGIub3JnLw==">DuckDB<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: To me personally, DuckDB is like SQLite but much much more powerful than that. I had used it to query JSON and CSV files directly without converting them to anything SQL. You basically get the best of both SQL and NoSQL when you integrate DuckDB.</li><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmlzaWRhdGEub3JnLw==">Visidata<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: A tool to explore data. Well, it&#39;s probably similar but different from DuckDB, you can use it to explore data in <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmlzaWRhdGEub3JnL2RvY3MvZm9ybWF0cy8=">various format<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. It&#39;s super useful if you have a terminal centric workflow like me.</li><li><strong><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL01laXR1YW4tRGlhbnBpbmcvbHlyZWJpcmQ=">Lyrebird<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></strong>: This one may be hard to sale because they do not have English documentation. However, it is a really powerful tool to capture and mock HTTP requests. It is meant to be used as a platform for automation testing, but it is much useful than that. I will create a dedicated post about this next year.</li></ul><h3 id="Readings"><a href="#Readings" class="headerlink" title="Readings"></a>Readings</h3><p>This year I consumed quite a lot of articles, my main source of technical articles comes from Hacker News and Lobster. I also have a list of RSS feeds I subscribe to. Whenever I found a good article, I usually bookmark them through my self-hosted <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3dhbGxhYmFnL3dhbGxhYmFn">Wallabag<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> instance running on the free Google Cloud VPS, most of these articles will eventually become individual episodes in a podcast I can listen and consume on the go. Some of my favorite articles this year are:</p><ul><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9qdm5zLmNhL2Jsb2cvMjAyNC8wOS8yNy9zb21lLWdvLXdlYi1kZXYtbm90ZXMv">Some Go web dev notes<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> -- this article had inspired me to rewrite the SQL part of my personal project written in Go.</li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9iZWxsbWFyLm1lZGl1bS5jb20vdGhyZWUtY3JpdGljYWwtcXVlc3Rpb25zLXRvLXR1cm4tdGhlLXRhYmxlLWR1cmluZy10ZWNobmljYWwtaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy1kZDE1OTRjMjc4Yjg=">Three Critical Questions to Turn the Tables During Technical Interviews<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm9pZGVhLmRvZy9nbHVl">Being Glue<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly95b3NlZmsuY29tL2Jsb2cvbWFuYWdlcnMtaGF2ZS1uby1odW1hbi1yaWdodHMuaHRtbA==">Managers have no human rights<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLndlc2thby5jb20vcC9ob3ctdG8tZ2l2ZS1hLXNlbmlvci1sZWFkZXItZmVlZGJhY2std2l0aG91dC1nZXR0aW5nLWZpcmVk">How to give a senior leader feedback (without getting fired)<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmF2YXMuc3BhY2UvdGVjaC11dG9waWEtZmFudGFzeS8=">the tech utopia fantasy is over<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly96YWtpcnVsbGluLm1kL2NvZ25pdGl2ZQ==">Cognitive load is what matters<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly95b3JpYy5naXRodWIuaW8vcG9zdC9jb2RpbmctZm9yLWEtZmluaXRlLXdvcmxkLw==">Coding for a Finite World<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9uaXNodGFoaXIuY29tL3doYXQtaXMtYS1zdGFmZi1lbmdpbmVlci8=">What is a Staff Engineer?<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li></ul><p>In the new year, I plan to summarize articles I have read once a month as well, just so I have a way to reflect on what I read in the past month.</p>]]>

Recently, an incident related to this particular functionality was reported to us.</p><h2 id="What-happened"><a href="#What-happened" class="headerlink" title="What happened"></a>What happened</h2><p>To explain things better, I&#39;ve created this sequence diagram below that represents a working scenario:</p><pre><code class="mermaid">sequenceDiagramAPP-&gt;&gt;webview: set a token as cookie in the webview.destroy APPwebview-&gt;&gt;APP: cookie is set.webview-&gt;&gt;Web App: Attempted to redirect to xxxx using the cookie.Web App-&gt;&gt;Web App: Grab the token from cookie.Web App-&gt;&gt;Backend: Check if this token is valid.Backend-&gt;&gt;Web App: This is a valid token, authentication successful.Web App-&gt;&gt;webview: Go to xxxx.</code></pre><span id="more"></span><p>In the incident, however, the user is unable to proceed to xxxx, because the web app was sending an empty token to the Backend, causing the Backend to reject it.</p><h2 id="Investigation-and-Root-Cause-Analysis"><a href="#Investigation-and-Root-Cause-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Investigation and Root Cause Analysis"></a>Investigation and Root Cause Analysis</h2><p>We need to be able to reproduce the issue first before we can further our investigation into this. However, this turned out to be a tricky one as none of the devs were able to reproduce the issue on their device or simulator.</p><p>The iOS devs tend to think this is related to the web app or the Backend itself, or a rare bug in iOS webview. With the help from a web developer, we added a log so we can see how often this issue happens in production.</p><p>A week after that, we realized the issue is not just impacting 2 or 3 users but a lot more. So we decided to have another look at the App source code.</p><p>Here&#39;s the relevant part of the code:</p><figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> dateFormatter <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="type">DateFormatter</span>()</span><br><span class="line">dateFormatter.dateFormat <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">&quot;E, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> cookieExpireDate <span class="operator">=</span> dateFormatter.date(from: setup.cookieExpires) <span class="operator">??</span> <span class="type">Date</span>(timeIntervalSinceNow: <span class="number">1</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> httpCookieProperties: [<span class="type">HTTPCookiePropertyKey</span> : <span class="keyword">Any</span>] <span class="operator">=</span> [</span><br><span class="line">    .domain: urlComponents.host <span class="operator">??</span> <span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    .path: urlComponents.path,</span><br><span class="line">    .name: setup.cookieName,</span><br><span class="line">    .value: accessToken,</span><br><span class="line">    .secure: urlComponents.scheme <span class="operator">??</span> <span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    .expires: cookieExpireDate</span><br><span class="line">]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">let</span> cookie <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="type">HTTPCookie</span>(properties: httpCookieProperties) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    webView.configuration.websiteDataStore.httpCookieStore.setCookie(cookie) &#123;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To people who are not familiar with Swift, this may not mean anything. However, it&#39;s not difficult to guess what this part of the code is doing. It first setup a formatter, and then use that formatter to create an expiry date (from the date it gets from the Backend) as the cookie. And then the cookie was given to the webview to set to the cookieStore.</p><p>What could go wrong here? My first instinct is where the cookieExpireDate is set. The fallback is set to 1 second, that is definitely too short, but that may not be the issue.</p><p>I subsequently looked up the dateFormatter online, among the documentation provide by Apple<sup><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuYXBwbGUuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50YXRpb24vZm91bmRhdGlvbi9kYXRlZm9ybWF0dGVyIzI1MjgyNjE=">1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></sup>, there&#39;s a link to a technical FAQ<sup><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuYXBwbGUuY29tL2xpYnJhcnkvYXJjaGl2ZS9xYS9xYTE0ODAvX2luZGV4Lmh0bWw=">2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></sup>. This was the key to finding the root cause. I will quote part of the FAQ document here:</p><blockquote><p>[...]<br>Q:  I&#39;m using NSDateFormatter to parse an Internet-style date, but this fails for some users in some regions. I&#39;ve set a specific date format string; shouldn&#39;t that force NSDateFormatter to work independently of the user&#39;s region settings?<br>A: No. While setting a date format string will appear to work for most users, it&#39;s not the right solution to this problem. There are many places where format strings behave in unexpected ways. For example:<br>A user can change their calendar (using System Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Region &gt; Calendar on OS X, or Settings &gt; General &gt; International &gt; Calendar on iOS). In that case NSDateFormatter will treat the numbers in the string you parse as if they were in the user&#39;s chosen calendar. For example, if the user selects the Buddhist calendar, parsing the year &quot;2010&quot; will yield an NSDate in 1467, because the year 2010 on the Buddhist calendar was the year 1467 on the (Gregorian) calendar that we use day-to-day.<br>[...]<br>On the other hand, if you&#39;re working with fixed-format dates, you should first set the locale of the date formatter to something appropriate for your fixed format. In most cases the best locale to choose is &quot;en_US_POSIX&quot;, a locale that&#39;s specifically designed to yield US English results regardless of both user and system preferences. &quot;en_US_POSIX&quot; is also invariant in time (if the US, at some point in the future, changes the way it formats dates, &quot;en_US&quot; will change to reflect the new behaviour, but &quot;en_US_POSIX&quot; will not), and between machines (&quot;en_US_POSIX&quot; works the same on iOS as it does on OS X, and as it it does on other platforms).</p></blockquote><p>Upon reading this, I immediately set my simulator to use Buddhist calendar, and<br>not surprisingly, I was able to reproduce the issue. Setting a breakpoint in<br>the code, I saw the cookieExpireDate had a year 1481 in it. This caused the<br>webview to ignore this cookie, and led to all the subsequent issues.</p><h2 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h2><p>There are several ways of fixing this issue, however, I do want to note first, Apple <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kZXZlbG9wZXIuYXBwbGUuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50YXRpb24vZm91bmRhdGlvbi9kYXRlZm9ybWF0dGVyIzI1MjgyNjE=">no longer recommends using DateFormatter in Swift<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.

<p>Nowadays, it&#39;s quite common for an iOS or Android app to include a webview, and at the company I worked in, we have a similar setup -- the app would hand over to a webview and the user would continue their journey in the web. Recently, an incident related to this particular functionality was reported to us.</p>
<h2 id="What-happened"><a href="#What-happened" class="headerlink" title="What happened"></a>What happened</h2><p>To explain things better, I&#39;ve created this sequence diagram below that represents a working scenario:</p>

Backend-&gt;&gt;Web App: This is a valid token, authentication successful.

      <![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday afternoon, we received an email from a colleague in our company, she mentioned the video in our app was not playing correctly. And what&#39;s strange about this is, the issue only impacted iOS users and not Android users, this usually indicates the problem is not with our app (or the back-end). The subsequent investigation on this turned out to be very interesting.</p><h2 id="Locating-the-issue"><a href="#Locating-the-issue" class="headerlink" title="Locating the issue"></a>Locating the issue</h2><p>We suspected this was a issue with media codec at first: iOS does not offer the variety of codecs that are supported on Android, therefore, would be much easier to get into an issue like this. However, the person reported this issue also mentioned the video was working fine a few days ago, so it&#39;s highly unlikely this is the source of the issue.</p><p>The next step was to look through the logs. We discovered there were quite a lot of errors thrown on connection reset from our identity gateway. This turned out to be a red herring -- we played the video in Android and the same error appeared.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="On-the-right-track"><a href="#On-the-right-track" class="headerlink" title="On the right track"></a>On the right track</h2><p>Desperate for more clues, we turned to one of the more experienced engineers from the other team for help. He asked me to share the headers that&#39;s sent with the video requests. This turned out to be helpful and eventually got us to the root cause.</p><p>Here are some of the request headers sent from the iOS app:</p><figure class="highlight http"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Cookie</span><span class="punctuation">: </span>REDACTED</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">X-Playback-Session-Id</span><span class="punctuation">: </span>REDACTED</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Range</span><span class="punctuation">: </span>bytes=0-1</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">Accept</span><span class="punctuation">: </span>*/*</span><br><span class="line"><span class="attribute">User-Agent</span><span class="punctuation">: </span>AppleCoreMedia/1.0.0.21F90 (iPhone;

      <![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday afternoon, we received an email from a colleague in our company, she mentioned the video in our app was not playing correctly. And what&#39;s strange about this is, the issue only impacted iOS users and not Android users, this usually indicates the problem is not with our app (or the back-end). The subsequent investigation on this turned out to be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="Locating-the-issue"><a href="#Locating-the-issue" class="headerlink" title="Locating the issue"></a>Locating the issue</h2><p>We suspected this was a issue with media codec at first: iOS does not offer the variety of codecs that are supported on Android, therefore, would be much easier to get into an issue like this. However, the person reported this issue also mentioned the video was working fine a few days ago, so it&#39;s highly unlikely this is the source of the issue.</p>
<p>The next step was to look through the logs. We discovered there were quite a lot of errors thrown on connection reset from our identity gateway. This turned out to be a red herring -- we played the video in Android and the same error appeared.</p>]]>

In all other cases, it will emit CommonJS by default, so in the example given, since I didn&#39;t had <code>type: module</code> inside a package.json, CommonJS will be emitted. <strong>BUT</strong>, dynamic import is still a ECMAScript feature, this leads to the next question.</p><h3 id="Why-was-the-emitted-JavaScript-code-behaving-like-that"><a href="#Why-was-the-emitted-JavaScript-code-behaving-like-that" class="headerlink" title="Why was the emitted JavaScript code behaving like that?"></a>Why was the emitted JavaScript code behaving like that?</h3><p>This is an interesting question.

      <![CDATA[<p>In this article, I&#39;m going to write about what I learnt from solving an issue I encountered during a refactoring of existing code.</p>
<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>In a TypeScript project, we used the following tsconfig file:</p>
<figure class="highlight json"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="punctuation">&#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">&quot;compilerOptions&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="punctuation">&#123;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;lib&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="punctuation">[</span><span class="string">&quot;es2023&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">]</span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;module&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="string">&quot;node16&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;target&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="string">&quot;es2022&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;strict&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="literal"><span class="keyword">true</span></span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;allowJs&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="literal"><span class="keyword">true</span></span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;esModuleInterop&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="literal"><span class="keyword">true</span></span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;skipLibCheck&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="literal"><span class="keyword">true</span></span><span class="punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">&quot;moduleResolution&quot;</span><span class="punctuation">:</span> <span class="string">&quot;node16&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="punctuation">&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="punctuation">&#125;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In our existing code, we have a js&#x2F;ts file that&#39;s only exporting an array of numbers as default export like below:</p>

      <![CDATA[<div class="note info"><p>This is the third article about NeoVim tips, if you are interested in other part of this, please check <a href="/2022/05/21/neovim-tricks-1/">here</a> and <a href="/2022/10/29/neovim-tricks-2">here</a></p></div><h3 id="Motivation-The-need-for-a-clean-and-organized-environment-file"><a href="#Motivation-The-need-for-a-clean-and-organized-environment-file" class="headerlink" title="Motivation: The need for a clean and organized environment file."></a>Motivation: The need for a clean and organized environment file.</h3><p>Quite often in a project, a developer will have to deal with a lot of environment variables and&#x2F;or environment files. However, they could also be the part that&#39;s least maintained in the entire codebase. As an example, sometimes, a feature flag could be added to the environment file, but when the feature goes live, people would fail to remove them. As time gets by, there will be <strong>A LOT</strong> of this kind of variables in the environment file.</p><p>As it is the end of the year, and I really couldn&#39;t finish much dev work with the amount of time left for the new year, I opt to deal with this issue with the intention to create a clean and organized environment file.</p><h3 id="Overview-What-s-in-an-environment-file"><a href="#Overview-What-s-in-an-environment-file" class="headerlink" title="Overview: What&#39;s in an environment file"></a>Overview: What&#39;s in an environment file</h3><p>Before I get into the problem I&#39;m trying to solve, it is important to understand the problem we are trying to solve. For the project I&#39;m working on, we have two kinds of environment files, one of which is only used locally, the other one is used by the Kubernetes platform and is used at runtime. Here&#39;s an example of what they look like:</p><span id="more"></span><figure class="highlight sh"><figcaption><span>local_env_file.env</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A_SERVICE               = http://abcdefg.tld</span><br><span class="line">PORT                    = 53100</span><br><span class="line">B_SERVICE               = http://bcdefg.tld</span><br><span class="line">FEATURE_FLAG_AAA        = <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line">C_SERVICE               = http://cdefg.tld</span><br><span class="line">FEATURE_FLAG_CCC_UNUSED = <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line">D_SERVICE               = http://defg.tld</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight yaml"><figcaption><span>helm_values.env.yaml</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">A_SERVICE</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="string">http://abcdefg.tld</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">PORT</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="number">53100</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">B_SERVICE</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="string">http://bcdefg.tld</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">FEATURE_FLAG_AAA</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">C_SERVICE</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="string">http://cdefg.tld</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">FEATURE_FLAG_CCC_UNUSED</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="attr">name:</span> <span class="string">D_SERVICE</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">value:</span> <span class="string">http://defg.tld</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This is only a short snippet of the file, the whole file would be around 200 lines. Obviously, this kind of long file is not maintainable and it could also become source of unexpected bugs&#x2F;failures if not dealt with carefully.

And also note the unused feature flags and services are both removed.</p><h3 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h3><p>Once I&#39;ve defined the end state, I went and started implementing it. To be honest, it look much difficult than it looked. I will break things by steps, so it&#39;s easier to explain.</p><h4 id="Organizing-services-and-feature-flags"><a href="#Organizing-services-and-feature-flags" class="headerlink" title="Organizing services and feature flags"></a>Organizing services and feature flags</h4><p>This might be the easiest task of all. You would first need to find all the lines that contains FEATURE_FLAGS or SERVICES. Then you would need to copy them all to a <strong>single</strong> register and paste them all out together.</p><p>What I did, for the <code>.env</code> file: clear the <code>b</code> register first with <code>qbq</code>, then do <code>:g/FEATURE_FLAG/:norm &quot;Bdd</code>, then go to the end of the file with <code>G</code> and paste with <code>&quot;Bp</code></p><p>Similarly, for the <code>helm_values</code> file, you can slightly modify the command used above to: <code>:g/FEATURE_FLAG/:norm &quot;B2dd</code>. This is because in the yaml file we have, the name and value are on separate lines.</p><h3 id="Removing-unused-services-and-feature-flags"><a href="#Removing-unused-services-and-feature-flags" class="headerlink" title="Removing unused services and feature flags"></a>Removing unused services and feature flags</h3><p>This is the most tedious part. It would be much ideal if this could be done as part of the regular release or clean up process. However, I still opt to do it with some not-so-intuitive VIM scripting.</p><p>To understand how to solve this, we need to clearly understand an unused variable is a variable that&#39;s not appeared in the code base. To me, this means <strong>you won&#39;t be able to find any usage for the variable by doing a code search</strong>. Based on this criteria, we can come up with some Vim script:</p><ul><li>For a env file:</li></ul><figure class="highlight vim"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">:g!/^#/<span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="keyword">x</span> = <span class="built_in">system</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;rg -t &quot;js&quot; -t &quot;ts&quot; -l --count-matches &#x27;</span> . <span class="built_in">shellescape</span>(<span class="built_in">expand</span>(<span class="string">&quot;&lt;cword&gt;&quot;</span>)) .. <span class="string">&#x27;|grep &quot;&quot; -c&#x27;</span>)|<span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">x</span>==<span class="number">0</span> |<span class="keyword">delete</span>|<span class="keyword">endif</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It looks complex, but it does what it meant to do. Let&#39;s break it down to see what it does step-by-step:</p><ul><li><code>:g</code> this is the typical Vim <code>:global</code> command where it would apply a series of ex commands on lines that matches the following pattern.</li><li><code>!/^#/</code> this is the regex we are looking for. In this case, it means any lines that <strong>do not</strong> start with a <code>#</code> or hash sign.</li><li><code>let x = system(&#39;xxxxx&#39;)</code> this is defining a vim variable called x, and assign the output of the command <code>xxxx</code> to variable x.</li><li><code>rg -t &quot;js&quot; -t &quot;ts&quot; -l --count-matches &#39; . shellescape(expand(&quot;&lt;cword&gt;&quot;)) .. &#39;</code> this is running <code>rg</code> command in a shell, you can actually replace this with <code>grep</code> but I find <code>rg</code> to be much more efficient.<ul><li>For <code>rg</code>, I used the following flags:<ul><li><code>-t</code> argument would tell <code>rg</code> which type of file to look for</li><li><code>-l</code> argument means &#39;Print only the paths with at least one match and suppress match contents&#39;.</li><li><code>--count-matches</code> means suppresses  normal  output and shows the number of individual matches of the given patterns for each file searched.</li></ul></li><li>Notice the <code>.</code> immediately following the single quote, that is used for concatenating commands.</li><li><code>shellescape()</code> function is used for escaping {string} for use as a shell command argument.</li><li><code>expand()</code> function, is used to expand expand wildcards and the following special keywords in {string}. When combined with <cword> <code>expand(&lt;cword&gt;)</code>, it would expand to word under the cursor.</li><li><code>|grep &quot;&quot; -c</code> this <bar> character that follows removes the new line or empty character from the rg output, note this is still part of the shell command sequence.</li><li><code>|if x==0 |delete|endif</code>, this is the final part of the command, it&#39;s straightforward: it&#39;s checking whether <code>x</code> is equal to 0. <code>x</code> is the variable we used to store the count of matches, so if the match is equal to 0, we delete the current line and end the if statement.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I have to admit, this is a relatively counter-intuitive command, but it&#39;s quite convenient to use. Depending on the size of your file and  CPU speed of your computer, your VIM might freeze for a short while, as it is executing some heavy I&#x2F;O command under the hood.</p><ul><li>For a <code>yaml</code> file:</li></ul><figure class="highlight vim"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">:g/name: \([A-Z].*\)/<span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="keyword">x</span> = <span class="built_in">system</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;rg -t &quot;js&quot; -t &quot;ts&quot; -l --count-matches &#x27;</span> . <span class="built_in">shellescape</span>(<span class="built_in">matchstr</span>(<span class="built_in">getline</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;.&#x27;</span>), <span class="string">&#x27;\&lt;\u.\+\&gt;&#x27;</span>)) .. <span class="string">&#x27;|grep &quot;&quot; -c&#x27;</span>)|<span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">x</span>==<span class="number">0</span> |<span class="keyword">delete</span> <span class="number">2</span>|<span class="keyword">endif</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Again, I will explain this one as well, most of the things are the same.</p><ul><li>For the pattern part, I switched to use <code>name: \([A-Z].*\)</code>, this would match the line that contains <code>name</code> and also capture whatever comes after the <code>name</code> part.</li><li>Inside the <code>shellescape</code> function, I switched to use <code>matchstr()</code> function which returns the matched string. In this case, it matching <code>getline(&#39;.&#39;)</code> against pattern <code>&#39;\&lt;\u.\+\&gt;&#39;</code> which is any upper case character.</li><li>All the other part of the command remain the same, except <code>delete 2</code>, this is because for the yaml file, I would like to delete both the name and value which consists of two lines.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In this article, I explore the use of shell command in combination with Vim to solve some the repetitive task of finding and deleting unused variables in a file inside a project.</p><hr><p>References:</p><ul><li>man rg(1)</li><li>VIM:<ul><li>:help :g</li><li>:help system()</li><li>:help shellescape()</li><li>:help expand()</li><li>:help matchstr()</li></ul></li></ul>]]>

However, they could also be the part that&#39;s least maintained in the entire codebase. As an example, sometimes, a feature flag could be added to the environment file, but when the feature goes live, people would fail to remove them. As time gets by, there will be <strong>A LOT</strong> of this kind of variables in the environment file.</p>
<p>As it is the end of the year, and I really couldn&#39;t finish much dev work with the amount of time left for the new year, I opt to deal with this issue with the intention to create a clean and organized environment file.</p>

For the project I&#39;m working on, we have two kinds of environment files, one of which is only used locally, the other one is used by the Kubernetes platform and is used at runtime. Here&#39;s an example of what they look like:</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>This article is a continuation of my previous article on Traefik, which you can find <a href="/2023/07/14/Easy-Self-Hosting-with-Traefik-Proxy">here</a>. Previously, I went through some examples of how I used Traefik so this article would assume you have the basic knowledge of Traefik, if you are not comfortable with it, feel free to go back to my article or read the official documentation <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly90cmFlZmlrLmlvL3RyYWVmaWsv">from traefik<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p><h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I&#39;ve been hosting some apps in my local home network using Raspberry Pi for a while now, and I&#39;ve also hosted some apps on Google Cloud.</p><p>Whenever I want to access things on Raspberry Pi while not at home, I would have to use <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9uZWJ1bGEuZGVmaW5lZC5uZXQvZG9jcy8=">Nebula<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> which is a tool for overlay network. I would have to connect to the VPN, and then access the applications.</p><p>This proves to be inconvenient, and not easy to use.

      <![CDATA[<p>This article is a continuation of my previous article on Traefik, which you can find <a href="/2023/07/14/Easy-Self-Hosting-with-Traefik-Proxy">here</a>. Previously, I went through some examples of how I used Traefik so this article would assume you have the basic knowledge of Traefik, if you are not comfortable with it, feel free to go back to my article or read the official documentation <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly90cmFlZmlrLmlvL3RyYWVmaWsv">from traefik<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I&#39;ve been hosting some apps in my local home network using Raspberry Pi for a while now, and I&#39;ve also hosted some apps on Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Whenever I want to access things on Raspberry Pi while not at home, I would have to use <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9uZWJ1bGEuZGVmaW5lZC5uZXQvZG9jcy8=">Nebula<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> which is a tool for overlay network. I would have to connect to the VPN, and then access the applications.</p>
<p>This proves to be inconvenient, and not easy to use. One day, I started to play around with the idea of putting things together with Traefik, and it worked so well and drives me to write this article.</p>
<h2 id="Why-hosting-things-separately"><a href="#Why-hosting-things-separately" class="headerlink" title="Why hosting things separately?"></a>Why hosting things separately?</h2><p>Some may wonder, why I would host things in both Raspberry Pi and GCP. Well, the main reason for this is cost efficiency and data privacy&#x2F;security.</p>
<p>You can use whatever CPU and storage you want within your local network without incurring monthly costs, and you would have the added benefits of having data on premise.</p>]]>

One of the things that annoys me is I have to remember to turn off my headset every time I leave my workplace, otherwise because the Bluetooth is not disconnected automatically when the Mac goes to sleep, I will find a headphone with very low battery the next day. If the Bluetooth is disconnected, the headphone will turn itself off in 5 mins, so it all comes down to remembering to disconnect Bluetooth on the laptop, or to turn off the battery on the headphone. This annoys me so much that I eventually decided to spend time to solve this problem.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="Analysis"><a href="#Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Analysis"></a>Analysis</h3><p>There are several ways to solve this issue, but everything comes down to a shell script, the only difference is how you would trigger the shell script.</p><ol><li>Manually trigger the shell script. This is obviously less than ideal, one would still remember to trigger the script every day from the terminal.</li><li>Manually trigger from the <code>Shortcut</code> app. This improved a bit, but still not ideal cause it is still not automated to full potential.<br>Now both 1 &amp; 2 would require manual intervention, I would like things to be fully automated, and can run even when the laptop is locked, so I come up with the next option:</li><li>Automatically trigger from calendar. This would be the most ideal, cause it is possible to control the time of the trigger, and is fully automated.</li></ol><h3 id="Prerequisite"><a href="#Prerequisite" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisite:"></a>Prerequisite:</h3><ul><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3RveS9ibHVldXRpbC90cmVlL21haW4=">Blueutil<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li>Automator<br>  (The builtin automation app in MacOS from Apple)</li></ul><h3 id="Attempt-1-Calendar-Automation-Through-Shell-Script"><a href="#Attempt-1-Calendar-Automation-Through-Shell-Script" class="headerlink" title="Attempt 1: Calendar Automation Through Shell Script"></a>Attempt 1: Calendar Automation Through Shell Script</h3><p>My first attempt was a simple POC through shell script through calendar automation. I first created an calendar alarm script within Automator, this depends on the Blueutil mentioned earlier. Here&#39;s the script:</p><figure class="highlight sh"><figcaption><span>Toggling Bluetooth Through CLI</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $(/opt/homebrew/bin/blueutil --is-connected <span class="string">&quot;REPLACE_WITH_BLUETOOTH_MAC_ADDRESS&quot;</span>) == 1 ]]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">/opt/homebrew/bin/blueutil --disconnect <span class="string">&quot;REPLACE_WITH_BLUETOOTH_MAC_ADDRESS&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $? == 0 ]] <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">osascript -e <span class="string">&#x27;display notification &quot;Headphone disconnected&quot; with title &quot;Headphone&quot;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span></span><br><span class="line">/opt/homebrew/bin/blueutil --connect <span class="string">&quot;REPLACE_WITH_BLUETOOTH_MAC_ADDRESS&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $? == 0 ]] <span class="keyword">then</span></span><br><span class="line">osascript -e <span class="string">&#x27;display notification &quot;Headphone connected&quot; with title &quot;Headphone&quot;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">fi</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I tested this script in command line several times and made sure I&#39;m happy with it. In the Automator, I created a calendar alarm automation, and chose the run shell script action, and put the command above as the script. Once this is saved, I created a calendar entry in the Calendar app, and chose alert and then select open file. The path to the workflow is <code>~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Calendar</code>.</p><h4 id="Caveats"><a href="#Caveats" class="headerlink" title="Caveats"></a>Caveats</h4><p>While this works quite well, I would sometimes work after the time set in the calendar entry, this means I could be in a call with someone when the script is triggered, and my headphone would be disconnected during a call (which is really embarrassing)</p><h3 id="Final-Solution-Notification-with-Option-to-Continue-or-Cancel"><a href="#Final-Solution-Notification-with-Option-to-Continue-or-Cancel" class="headerlink" title="Final Solution: Notification with Option to Continue or Cancel"></a>Final Solution: Notification with Option to Continue or Cancel</h3><p>After some struggling, I found a solution I&#39;m happy with -- display a dialogue window asking for confirmation before disconnecting Bluetooth.<br>On top of the previous script, I added a new step to my Automator script, which is running an Apple Script, I added:</p><figure class="highlight applescript"><figcaption><span>Toggling Bluetooth Through CLI</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">on</span> <span class="built_in">run</span> &#123;input, parameters&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">display dialog</span> <span class="string">&quot;Disconnecting Bluetooth automatically, click “Cancel” if you would like to cancel.

If cancel was chosen, the entire workflow will be cancelled, so Bluetooth will not be disconnected. If continue was chosen, it will continue.</p><h3 id="Future-improvement"><a href="#Future-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Future improvement"></a>Future improvement</h3><p>I can actually potentially combine the AppleScript and the Shell script and just use one step instead of two.</p><h3 id="Lessons-Learnt"><a href="#Lessons-Learnt" class="headerlink" title="Lessons Learnt"></a>Lessons Learnt</h3><p>I&#39;m quite happy with the final solution I came up with. What I learnt is:</p><ul><li>Apple Calendar events would still trigger alerts even when the laptop is locked.</li><li>One can use <code>display dialog</code> in AppleScript to trigger dialog confirmation.</li></ul>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m a big fan of Arch Linux for its simplicity, and ease to use. However, sometimes it can be the source of headache. This week, I upgraded the Arch Linux on my Raspberry Pi 3 with latest packages with the following command <code>yay -Syu --noconfirm</code> (WARNING: you shouldn&#39;t be doing this). When I finished upgrade, my Raspberry Pi 3 stopped working.

I am expecting this to be difficult cause Raspberry Pi is ARM based, and my laptop is not. It turned out to be really difficult because I wasn&#39;t familiar with how chroot and mounting works.</p><p>To chroot into an ARM-based machine (in this case aarch64 architecture), you would normally need an ARM based machine. If you really want to do it from a x86_64 architecture machine, you would have to setup some kind of emulation. In this case, I&#39;m using QEMU, which is a pretty standard tool for emulation on Linux. Here&#39;s the steps I followed:</p><ul><li>Install QEMU related packages:</li></ul><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S qemu-user-static qemu-user-static-binfmt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>These two packages are both necessary.

Instead, it would run the binary with static translation.</p><ul><li>You would also need to install some cross-compiling libraries:</li></ul><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S aarch64-linux-gnu-glibc</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ul><li>Insert your MicroSD card to your machine, mount the <code>/boot</code> partition and the <code>/</code> (root) partition, can be something like below, you would need to run as root:</li></ul><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo mount --<span class="built_in">mkdir</span> /dev/sdX2 /mnt/sdcard/</span><br><span class="line">sudo mount --<span class="built_in">mkdir</span> /dev/sdX1 /mnt/sdcard/boot</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><ul><li>Once this is done, you can follow the steps <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93aWtpLmFyY2hsaW51eC5vcmcvdGl0bGUvUUVNVSNDaHJvb3RpbmdfaW50b19hcm0vYXJtNjRfZW52aXJvbm1lbnRfZnJvbV94ODZfNjQ=" title="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;QEMU#Chrooting_into_arm&#x2F;arm64_environment_from_x86_64">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.

Initially, I was thinking it was my host machine that has the issue, so I copied the file <code>ld-linux-aarch64.so.1</code> from <code>/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1</code>. And it still didn&#39;t work. I had spent almost one hour on this before I realized, the issue lies with my <code>chroot</code> and <strong>not</strong> my host machine. I had to do create a symbolic link from <code>/usr/lib</code> to <code>/lib</code> in the <code>chroot</code> (i.e. the sdcard file system). This time, I got <code>segmentation fault</code> when I did the chroot.</p><p>At this point, I might as well reinstall the whole ArchLinux.

I would recommend setting the boot partition to be <strong>more</strong> than 200MB, 400MB would be ideal.</p><p>Once you are done with installation, I would recommend <strong>not</strong> to put your MicroSD card back to your Raspberry yet. Instead, you should chroot into the mounted folder and start installing some packages.

However, things still didn&#39;t work as expected: the machine booted, but it had no Ethernet or WiFi access. I also noticed the lights were blinking wrongly. This made me think the whole situation had something to do with kernel. So, I had to plug the MicroSD back to my laptop and switch the kernel and install the <code>linux-rpi</code> <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9hcmNobGludXhhcm0ub3JnL3BhY2thZ2VzL2FhcmNoNjQvbGludXgtcnBp" title="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archlinuxarm.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;aarch64&#x2F;linux-rpi">package<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sudo pacman -S linux-rpi</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This package is RPi Foundation patched Linux kernel and modules which turned out to solve the issue. You would be asked if you want to replace the current kernel and the u-boot. Go ahead and say yes. Now, if you had followed the official guide from ArchLinux Arm, you would get an error, because 200MB on the boot drive is not enough for installing a second kernel package when the current kernel is present (this is the reason I recommend using more than 200MB on boot partition). For me, I had to delete some files from the <code>/boot/dtbs</code> folder (which I don&#39;t recommend doing). This folder is for device tree blobs, so there might be unexpected consequences for deleting random files. </p><p>After rebooting and start using the kernel from RPi Foundation, everything would work as expected. I continued with some housekeeping tasks:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># install cron</span></span><br><span class="line">sudo pacman -S cronie &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl <span class="built_in">enable</span> --now cronie</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># set the hostname</span></span><br><span class="line">hostnamectl hostname raspberrypi</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># set timezone</span></span><br><span class="line">sudo timedatectl set-timezone Pacific/Auckland</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># add the default user to sudoer</span></span><br><span class="line">sudo visudo</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Add the following lines:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># alarm ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Defaults:alarm !authenticate</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># set locale to utf-8</span></span><br><span class="line">localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I also compiled the aur helper from my laptop and transferred it RPi -- it just takes forever to compile things on RPi.

Basically, Linux knows to use aarch64 related emulation when you are inside the chroot -- there&#39;s a mapping from the binary format to the interpreter at runtime. For example, I had this <code>/usr/lib/binfmt.d/qemu-aarch64-static.conf</code> file which contains<br><code>:qemu-aarch64:M::\x7fELF\x02\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\xb7\x00:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff:/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static:FP</code><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3FlbXUvcWVtdS9ibG9iL2YzMTE2MGM3ZDFiODljZmI0ZGQ0MDAxYTIzNTc1YjQyMTQxY2IwZWMvcWVtdS1kb2MudGV4aSNMMjU5MA==" title="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;blob&#x2F;f31160c7d1b89cfb4dd4001a23575b42141cb0ec&#x2F;qemu-doc.texi#L2590">This would allow QEMU execute programs for other processor architectures as if they were native binaries.<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li>Setting up a system through chroot is much easier than doing things over SSH, this is especially true if you are dealing with Raspberry Pi or something that&#39;s not powerful enough.</li></ul><hr><h4 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References:"></a>References:</h4><p><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93aWtpLmFyY2hsaW51eC5vcmcvdGl0bGUvUUVNVSNEZXRhaWxzX29uX3BhY2thZ2VzX2F2YWlsYWJsZV9pbl9BcmNoX0xpbnV4">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU#Details_on_packages_available_in_Arch_Linux<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93aWtpLmFyY2hsaW51eC5vcmcvdGl0bGUvUUVNVSNDaHJvb3RpbmdfaW50b19hcm0vYXJtNjRfZW52aXJvbm1lbnRfZnJvbV94ODZfNjQ=">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU#Chrooting_into_arm/arm64_environment_from_x86_64<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9hcmNobGludXhhcm0ub3JnL3BsYXRmb3Jtcy9hcm12OC9icm9hZGNvbS9yYXNwYmVycnktcGktMw==">https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvQmluZm10X21pc2M=">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3FlbXUvcWVtdS9ibG9iL2YzMTE2MGM3ZDFiODljZmI0ZGQ0MDAxYTIzNTc1YjQyMTQxY2IwZWMvcWVtdS1kb2MudGV4aSNMMjU5MA==">https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/f31160c7d1b89cfb4dd4001a23575b42141cb0ec/qemu-doc.texi#L2590<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve encountered an interesting issue with a project using TypeScript. In this article, I will describe the problem, the investigation I did and how I locate the root cause, and suggest some solutions.</p><h3 id="What-happened"><a href="#What-happened" class="headerlink" title="What happened"></a>What happened</h3><p>We have a project that&#39;s a &quot;pure&quot; TypeScript project -- the codebase contains no JavaScript file, except for some configuration. As part of the build process, TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript with <code>tsc</code>. Within the container, the project call node and runs the transpiled index.js, something like <code>node dist/src/index.js</code>.</p><p>When a PR was merged and deployed into one of the test environments, the container would not start and went into a crash loop state. This obviously is not a good sign. The initial step was checking the logs emitted from within the container. This revealed the cause of the crash was an imported module (imported with non-relative path) can not be found in one of the JavaScript file.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="Investigation-Reproduce"><a href="#Investigation-Reproduce" class="headerlink" title="Investigation &amp; Reproduce"></a>Investigation &amp; Reproduce</h3><p>The obvious first step for investigation, was to run the project with branch that caused the issue. Not surprisingly, the project ran just fine when running locally, and it even passed all tests. This, to me indicated the local setup did not match what&#39;s in the container.</p><p>Next, I checked the Dockerfile for the project and there was indeed some discrepancy between how the project runs in container vs how it runs using NPM. Locally, the project runs with <code>ts-node</code> which did not contain the transpile process. The container, was running using the transpiled JavaScript.</p><p>So now, when I ran the <code>tsc</code> locally and then ran the transpiled index.js file that&#39;s generated, I was able to reproduce the issue locally. I can see the module in question was imported using non-relative import.</p><p>Once I was able to reproduce the issue, I had several questions in mind that need to be answered:</p><ol><li>Why was there a module not found error when it was running fine locally (both tests, and actual server runs fine)?</li><li>Why wasn&#39;t TypeScript compiler reporting the error in Visual Studio Code?</li><li>How can this sort of issue be prevented?</li></ol><h3 id="Root-cause"><a href="#Root-cause" class="headerlink" title="Root cause"></a>Root cause</h3><div class="note warning"><p>I&#39;m not a fan of TypeScript, and the following analysis contains my personal opinions.</p></div><p>My conclusion was the answer to all of questions boils down to how this project was setup, more specifically how it uses TypeScript and the tsconfig file.</p><p>Modern day JavaScript has the concept of modules. A module can be imported in two ways, relative and non-relative. A relative imports, involves finding the path using relative path, that is, when you see something like <code>import helper from &#39;../../helper&#39;</code> is a relative import. Whereas, <code>import helper from &#39;tests/helpers&#39;</code> is an example of non-relative import. At runtime (or compile time for TypeScript), modules import one another using module loader <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlcy5odG1s">^1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. The process of how modules decide where to find the module to import from is called module resolution.</p><p>In most circumstances, you would prefer relative imports, which works fine if you don&#39;t have deeply nested folder structures. Non-relative imports are mostly for importing modules from third party NPM packages. However, once the projects gets larger, you would see non-relative imports even for modules that are not from third party which makes importing easier to understand and follow.</p><p>TypeScript <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlLXJlc29sdXRpb24uaHRtbCNob3ctdHlwZXNjcmlwdC1yZXNvbHZlcy1tb2R1bGVz">mimics NodeJS module resolution algorithm<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>. It also employs some flags to <strong>INFORM</strong> the compiler of what&#39;s expected to happen to module resolution at runtime. This is because, a project may have a different structure at runtime vs at build time. As an example, most front-end projects will be bundled to multiple JavaScript files, this is not representative of the project structure before it&#39;s built. One important thing to note here is that TypeScript compiler itself <strong>WILL NOT</strong> do any transformation on its own.</p><p>In <code>tsconfig</code>, <code>baseUrl</code> and <code>path</code> configuration are examples of the aforementioned flags.</p><ul><li><code>baseUrl</code>: Setting baseUrl informs the compiler where to find modules. All module imports with non-relative names are assumed to be relative to the baseUrl. <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlLXJlc29sdXRpb24uaHRtbCNiYXNlLXVybA==">^2<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li><li><code>path</code>:  this is a mapping between file and module, and should be used when modules sits outside of the baseUrl. <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlLXJlc29sdXRpb24uaHRtbCNwYXRoLW1hcHBpbmc=">^3<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></li></ul><p>The <code>tsconfig</code> file for this project in question contains the following line <code>baseUrl: ./src</code>. This has several implications:</p><ul><li>When writing code, someone could import other modules within src folder using non-relative names, this would <strong>NOT</strong> cause any issue.</li><li>At build time, TypeScript would emit JavaScript file with non-relative imports.</li><li>At runtime, depending on how the project is setup, there could be different consequences:<ul><li>If the final runtime code was bundled together using a bundler, chances are the project would run fine.</li><li>If the final runtime code was not bundled together, and nothing was done at project level to support the non-relative import, the project would fail at runtime, and emit a <code>module not found</code> error.</li></ul></li></ul><p>For the project I mentioned, <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2lsZWFybmlvL21vZHVsZS1hbGlhcw==">a NPM package called module-alias<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> was used. However, not all aliases are registered properly. This was what led to the <code>module not found</code> error at runtime.</p><h3 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h3><p>I think the key is to have consistency between the project setup and TypeScript configuration (tsconfig), that is, if the project is not using a bundler, the baseUrl should be used together with paths mapping. And anytime a new non-relative import is added in code, one should also check whether the alias has been setup correctly. </p><p>There are many ways to setup alias for non-relative path import:</p><ul><li>Using the <code>module-alias</code> NPM package. Note that this package is not a development dependency, you will have to include it in your actual dependency.</li><li>Using the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9ub2RlanMub3JnL2RvY3MvbGF0ZXN0LXYxOC54L2FwaS9wYWNrYWdlcy5odG1sI3N1YnBhdGgtaW1wb3J0cw==">subpath imports method<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> provided by NodeJS (this is only applicable in NodeJS project) which setup alias in package.json</li></ul><hr><h3 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h3><p><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlcy5odG1s">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span><br><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHlwZXNjcmlwdGxhbmcub3JnL2RvY3MvaGFuZGJvb2svbW9kdWxlLXJlc29sdXRpb24uaHRtbA==">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve encountered an interesting issue with a project using TypeScript. In this article, I will describe the problem, the investigation I did and how I locate the root cause, and suggest some solutions.</p>
<h3 id="What-happened"><a href="#What-happened" class="headerlink" title="What happened"></a>What happened</h3><p>We have a project that&#39;s a &quot;pure&quot; TypeScript project -- the codebase contains no JavaScript file, except for some configuration. As part of the build process, TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript with <code>tsc</code>. Within the container, the project call node and runs the transpiled index.js, something like <code>node dist/src/index.js</code>.</p>
<p>When a PR was merged and deployed into one of the test environments, the container would not start and went into a crash loop state. This obviously is not a good sign. The initial step was checking the logs emitted from within the container. This revealed the cause of the crash was an imported module (imported with non-relative path) can not be found in one of the JavaScript file.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>I&#39;ve been running Traefik to self-host some of the applications I like for a few month now, I&#39;m really happy with its performance as well as convenience and therefore would like to share my setup and experience in this article. I will give a brief introduction of what Traefik is for, how I used it, and general suggestions on using Traefik.</p><h3 id="What-is-Traefik"><a href="#What-is-Traefik" class="headerlink" title="What is Traefik?"></a>What is Traefik?</h3><p>By definition, Traefik is a reverse proxy and load balancer <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly90cmFlZmlrLmlvL3RyYWVmaWsv">^1<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.

One has to agree they are the de facto standard for web server and&#x2F;or reverse proxy. However, what I don&#39;t like about them is their configuration. It is just simply difficult to comprehend and get used to.</p><p>Nowadays, I usually choose to use run applications within a Docker container. While I was setting up one of the applications, they mentioned Docker and how to setup Traefik with Docker. Upon reading through the documentation of Traefik, I made the decision to switch to use Traefik. Mainly because how easy it is to setup if you are using Docker&#x2F;Docker Compose or Kubernetes.</p><h4 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h4><div class="note info"><ul><li>A machine where you are going to run your containers on. (VPS, or Raspberry Pi, etc.)</li><li>An application or two that you want to run in container.</li><li>Docker already installed</li><li>(Optional) Domain name</li></ul></div><p>You would (of course) need to have a VPS up and running and a domain name if you want to make those applications public accessible. For the VPS part, I am using the free-tier instance from GCP.<span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2Nsb3VkY29tbXVuaXR5L0Nsb3VkLUZyZWUtVGllci1Db21wYXJpc29uIzMtZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3Vk">^3<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> I opted to use the 10 GB &quot;balanced&quot; storage instead of the standard storage to get faster speed, which costs 1 USD per month. The performance is good enough for my current workload, I might double the size of the SSD at some point in the future.</p><h4 id="Setup-Traefik"><a href="#Setup-Traefik" class="headerlink" title="Setup Traefik"></a>Setup Traefik</h4><p>The setup of Traefik is intuitive, but not friction-free.

Once you do the <code>docker-compose up</code> with this file, you will have a running Docker container with Traefik proxy running in it. This configuration also expose the dashboard web UI by default at <code>example.domain.com</code> domain. You will want to setup the basicauth for the dashboard to protect information, this is done as <code>traefik.http.middlewares.auth.basicauth.users=YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD</code>, the password needs to be hashed, more information can be found at <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2MudHJhZWZpay5pby90cmFlZmlrL21pZGRsZXdhcmVzL2h0dHAvYmFzaWNhdXRoLw==">Traefik documentation on this topic<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>.</p><p>As you can guess, Traefik setup the proxy and its relevant configuration through labels on a docker container. Some might find this not clean, I&#39;m okay with it. There are other ways to do the configuration as documented in Traefik documentation.</p><h4 id="Setup-an-application"><a href="#Setup-an-application" class="headerlink" title="Setup an application"></a>Setup an application</h4><p>As an example, I will setup CyberChef to run as a docker container, and behind the Traefik proxy. If you are not familiar with <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9nY2hxLmdpdGh1Yi5pby9DeWJlckNoZWYv">CyberChef<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>, I highly recommend give it a go. It describes itself as:</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>A simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression.</p></blockquote><p>Technically speaking, most of the things it does can be done in command line, I would say it is still nice to have a Web UI. I probably use less than 5% of its feature, mostly using it to format JSON, and occasionally decode BASE64 or other stuff.</p><p>As with most self-host applications, it is open source.

The labels that contains <code>loadbalancer</code> will provide a simple health check mechanism for traefik to check the health of the container, the <code>server.port</code> indicates where the Traefik go to for this downstream application.</p><p>Now, if you run <code>docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d &amp;&amp; docker image prune -f &amp;&amp; docker compose logs -f</code>, you will be greeted with CyberChef if you go to the domain you setup.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you do not have any prior experience with NGINX or Apache, I tend to think this will be much easier to setup than NGINX or Apache.

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve encounter several situations where I have to deal with self-signed certificate. As this is such a common issue, I&#39;ve decided to write this article to document my learnings and for my own reference in the future.</p><p>This article will start by explaining what is a SSL certificate, and what is a self-signed certificate. From there, I will detail the problems I encountered recently on self-signed certificate, and how I solved them.</p><span id="more"></span><h3 id="What-is-a-SSL-certificate"><a href="#What-is-a-SSL-certificate" class="headerlink" title="What is a (SSL) certificate?"></a>What is a (SSL) certificate?</h3><p>A certificate, is something you used to prove you identity. For example, in most countries around the world, you would usually have something to identify who you are and prove you are who you claimed to be, this could be something like a driver license, and are usually issued by the government.</p><p>In the context of internet security, you&#39;ve got SSL certificate. This is something the browser would use to authenticate the identity of a website. An SSL certificate is most likely issued and signed by a trusted CA or certificate authority.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-self-signed-certificate"><a href="#What-is-a-self-signed-certificate" class="headerlink" title="What is a self-signed certificate?"></a>What is a self-signed certificate?</h3><p>To put it in short, a self-signed certificate is something that&#39;s issued and signed by the same party. In other words, this is like you have issued yourself a driver license, to identify and prove you are you. I&#39;m pretty sure you would have a hard time convincing people to accept that as a proof of your identity.</p><h3 id="Benefits-and-risks-associated-with-self-signed-certificate"><a href="#Benefits-and-risks-associated-with-self-signed-certificate" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and risks associated with self-signed certificate"></a>Benefits and risks associated with self-signed certificate</h3><p>It is quite obvious that to most people, self-signed certificate would pose a big risk. Because SSL certificate are usually used for HTTPS communication,  if a self-signed certificate is obtained from an untrusted source and installed on your computer, the malicious party can pretend to be a any website, and will be able to decrypt the HTTPS traffic from your computer. This is called Man-in-the-middle attack.</p><p>However, with increasingly strict requirement on HTTPS in most browsers, it is necessary to trust a self-signed certificate. Here are some common scenarios.</p><ul><li>In a large enterprise, the intranet traffic is usually not exposed to the public. In this situation, a self-signed certificate is appropriate because it would allow the traffic to be encrypted properly.</li><li>In a home or SOHO network environment, you may want to use a self-signed certificate on your router, this will stop your browser from complaining about HTTP traffic.</li><li>In a development environment, you may also want to use a self-signed certificate. This is so that you can utilize the Man-in-the-middle method and sniff some of the HTTPS traffic, making things easier to debug. (This is especially useful when you are doing mobile application development)</li></ul><h3 id="Issues-and-solutions"><a href="#Issues-and-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Issues and solutions"></a>Issues and solutions</h3><p>I would like to go over the issues I have encountered recently on self-signed certificates. In most situations, to solve the problem, you can either <strong>bypass</strong> or <strong>trust</strong>. <strong>Bypass</strong> means blindly trust all self-signed certificate and don&#39;t warn me again. <strong>Trust</strong> means trusting <strong>only</strong> the certificate in question, which means if you ever have another self-signed certificate, you would have to <strong>trust</strong> it again. Unless you have a very good reason, <strong>do not</strong> use the bypass solution.</p><h5 id="Using-self-signed-certificate-in-JavaScript-NodeJS"><a href="#Using-self-signed-certificate-in-JavaScript-NodeJS" class="headerlink" title="Using self-signed certificate in JavaScript&#x2F;NodeJS"></a>Using self-signed certificate in JavaScript&#x2F;NodeJS</h5><p>If you are a NodeJS developer, you would most likely to have encounter error message like <code>Self-signed certificate in certificate chain</code>. This error is actually from NodeJS https client, if you are using a third party library (like Apollo server client), you will have to dig and find how to pass custom http client to that library.</p><div class="tabs" id="solutions_node"><ul class="nav-tabs"><li class="tab active"><a href="#solutions_node-1">Solution 1: Bypass</a></li><li class="tab"><a

uses self-signed certificate, this turned out to be quite a challenge. I had to find ways to add the certificate Colima host machine for this to work correctly.<br>Here&#39;s the command I ran:<br><code>colima ssh -- sudo sh -c &quot;openssl s_client -showcerts -connect our-internal-url:443 &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM &gt; /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/internal.crt &amp;&amp; update-ca-certificates &amp;&amp; cat /var/run/docker.pid | xargs kill&quot;</code><br>This will download the certificate and install in the certificate storage in the colima VM in one go.</p><h4 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h4><p><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9naXN0LmdpdGh1Yi5jb20vamtyZW1zZXIvYTgxNDMzODQwNDliMTcxZDRlNjRjNWFlYjZkYTQ3OTM=">https://gist.github.com/jkremser/a8143384049b171d4e64c5aeb6da4793<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span></p><ul><li>Some of the code in this article was generated using ChatGPT.</li></ul>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#39;ve encounter several situations where I have to deal with self-signed certificate. As this is such a common issue, I&#39;ve decided to write this article to document my learnings and for my own reference in the future.</p>
<p>This article will start by explaining what is a SSL certificate, and what is a self-signed certificate. From there, I will detail the problems I encountered recently on self-signed certificate, and how I solved them.</p>]]>
